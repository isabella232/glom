1.15.1 (unstable):

* Uses Gnome::Gda::SqlBuilder in most places to avoid manually building SQL
  query strings. This should be more robust and safer.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Correct the position of "Records / Found" labels.
  (Daniel Borgmann)
* Find:
  - Make Find mode a toggle and move it to the Edit menu.
  - Fix a crash when using find mode.
  (Daniel Borgmann)
* List view:
  - Don't add a new row when cancelling editing of a placeholder row.
  - Don't allow placeholder rows to be delteted.
  (Daniel Borgmann)
* Build libglom and pyglom API documentation.
  (Murray Cumming, Daniel Elstner)

1.14.5 (stable):

* Allow unique fields with same name in multiple tables.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #625192 (fmyhr).

1.14.4 (stable):

* Developer menu: Added Export Backup and Restore Backup menu items.
  These use PostgreSQL's pg_dump and pg_restore utilities, wrapping the
  dump and .glom file up in a .tar.gz.
  As well as allowing backups of data, this should make it easier to upgrade
  the PostgreSQL version, which some distros do automatically when upgrading
  to new major versions of Glom. This is possible because pg_restore can
  work with the pg_dump output of an older PostgreSQL version.

  and pyglom (Python) API reference documentation (for use by Glom calculated
  fields and button scripts).
  (Murray Cumming, Daniel Elstner, David King)
* Added unit tests. (Murray Cumming)

1.14.0 (stable):

New features in Glom 1.14, compared to Glom 1.12:

  Allow custom formatting of static text and buttons instead of just fields.
* Field Formatting:
  - Add the option to use a different text color for negative values.
    Suggested by Mathias Hasselmann.
  - Add a horizontal alignment option, though we still right-align numbers
    by default. Bug #591125 (Patrick Chan)
  - Allow choices to be shown as radio buttons instead of a drop-down combo box.
    Requested by Frederik Vande Rieviere.
* Many small UI improvements.
* Field calculations and button scripts:
  - Fields values may now be changed like so:
    record["fieldname"] = 123
  - Simple navigation is posible via, for instance:

  (Murray Cumming, Openismus)
  - Don't show error dialog when user cancels creation from an example.
  (Daniel Borgmann, Openismus)
* Opening recent files: Warn when a file doesn't exist, and forget it,
  instead of just showing a generic error dialog.
  (Murray Cumming, Openismus)
* Python scripts and field calculations: Fix a Glom 1.13 bug with use of
  date fields.
* User Interface: General cleanup. The dialogs are more compliant with the
  GNOME HIG and there are many minor ixes to the user interface.
  (Daniel Borgmann, Openismus)

  and ui.start_new_record() methods.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Fix the build with exceptions disabled.
  (Peter Penz )

1.13.7 (unstable):

* Avoid a crash when a script navigates from a list view to another table.
  Maybe avoid similar warnings/crashes when doing normal navigation.

1.13.6 (unstable):

* Python scripts:
  - Fields value may now be changed like so:
    record["fieldname"] = 123
  - Simple navigation is posible via, for instance:

  foreground color and background color) for static text items and buttons.
  (Murray Cumming)

1.13.1 (unstable):

* Details and List layouts:
  Allow custom formatting of static text and buttons instead of just fields.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Field Formatting:
  - Add the option to use a different text color for negative values.
    (suggested by Mathias Hasselmann)
  - Add a horizontal alignment option, though we still right-align numbers
    by default. #591125 (Patrick Chan)
  (Murray Cumming)

  Fix a crash when calling python functions that return dates.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #603686. (Andrew Ruthven)
* Details layout:
  - Related records layout definition:
  When defining drop-down choices in the custom formatting, show the correct
  relationships. Noticed by Michael Hasselmann and Andrew Ruthven.
  (Murray Cumming)
  - Fix a crash when specifying a static image on the layout.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #600954 (Michael Hasselmann).
* Saving: Always add the xmlns ID to the document, to make MIME-type detection
  easier. (Murray Cumming)
* Do not mark an empty string for translation.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #599868 (André Klapper).
* Avoid some runtime warnings.
  (Murray Cumming)

  (Armin Burgmeier) Bug #599966 (Akishi Soda, Cinna)
* Maemo build: Don't depend on libgettextpo.
  (David King)
* Developer documentation:
  Correct the DTD and add a unit test to make sure it and the
  examples are correct.
  (Michael Hasselmann, Murray Cumming)

* Windows Build:
  - Builds for Windows again. (Armin Burgmeier)
* Build: Support Automake silent rules. (Daniel Elstner)
* Maemo Build:
  - Adapted for latest hildonmm API.
  - AppMenu: Add "Add" and "Add Related" buttons, instead of having +
    buttons in the window. This does not work perfectly and needs some work.
  - Make TextViews small initially.
  - Details:
    - Show the table name in the window title.
    - Use PickerButtons instead of ComboBoxes.
  - Widget spacing improvements to match the Maemo UI spec.
   (Murray Cumming)
  - Create a libosso D-Bus service and register it, so Glom can run in the
  background like a normal Maemo application.
  - Show the application and its icon in the applications menu.
  (David King)

  (Michael Hasselmann)


1.12.0 (stable):

What's new in Glom 1.12:

  time to wait until PostgreSQL should be ready is still a hard-coded number.
* Export:
  - Correct the export to use the CSV specification
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glom/+bug/394894 elmergato)
  - Don't open the format dialog behind the FileChooser dialog.
    Ubuntu Launchpad bug
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glom/+bug/397409 (elmergato)
  - Offer File overwrite confirmation.
    Ubuntu Launchpad bug
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glom/+bug/393229 (elmergato)

  - Add an ABI version (1.2) to the shared library and the headers location,
    so we may break ABI painlessly when we need to.
  - Remove any client-only or PostgreSQL/SQLite ifdefs, so that libglom always
    offers all functionality, to avoid the need to have multiple versions of
    libglom installed if you have multiple Glom builds installed. Only the
    no-exceptions build option remains, because they will never be on the same
    system.
  - Remove any Maemo-specific ifdefs because libglom is non-UI.
  - Fix the pkg-config .pc file.
  - Avoid calling g_thread_init() twice, fixing a crash.
  - Correct the headers' installation location.
 (David King, Openismus)

Glom 1.8

Major changes since 1.6:

New features:
* Import: Comma-separated data may now be imported into the
  current table, with the help of an assistant to choose the
  field mapping.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* Drag and Drop layout: Drag the layout items from the toolbar,
  or drag items to move them around the layout.
  (This feature may still have some bugs. The old layout window
   is still the default.)
  (Johannes Schmid)
* Print Layouts: precise layout of print outs for record details.
  (This feature is not really complete yet. The old HTML output
   is still available.)
  (Murray Cumming)
* Calendar Portal: See related records via a calendar, choosing
  one field to use for the date, and other fields to show on that
  day in the calendar.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Network sharing: Open running Glom systems via the network,
  without opening the file from the file system.
  (Murray Cumming, Mathias Hasselmann)
* New clearer initial dialog.

  portals, and their data appears in the printout, though the
  whole Print Layout feature is still rather unfinished.
* Print Layout list: Add a default title when adding a print layout.
* Related Records layout: Fix a bug that was introduced some time
  during 1.7.x, preventing static text and images from being added.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Drag and Drop layout: Add a related records toolbar item, to add
  portals to the layout.

1.7.2:

  (Murray Cumming)
* Build: Fixed a const problem with gtkmm 2.12.
* Improvements for the Windows port:
  - Check that the user is not admin (like root on Linux),
    because that would be a network security risk, and postgres
    checks too.
  - Hide the console windows when starting postgres, by using
    CreateProcess() instead of Glib::spawn().
  - Deal with some IO strangeness.
  - Initialize WinSock at startup so we can find an unused port.
  - Added the installer source files to svn.
  - Initial dialog: Hide the network item, because we do not have
    Avahi on Windows.
  (Armin Burgmeier)

* New Import feature, to import comma-separated rows of data into the
  current table.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* (Unfinished) drag-and-drop of layout items from a toolbar, and
  right-clicking to edit item details.

  (Murray Cumming, Armin Burgmeier)
* Now ignores previously-set multiline text formatting
  options for non-text fields.  Bug #443360 (Harry Mills)
  (Murray Cumming)

1.6.0 (stable)

* Depend on latest libgdamm, to fix handling of dates.
* Slightly improved handling of database server errors.

1.5.3 (unstable)

* Avoid unnecessary unsaved-changes warning dialogs.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Ignore previously-set multiline text formatting
  options for non-text fields,
  Bug #443360 (Harry Mills)
  (Murray Cumming)

1.5.2 (unstable)

* Fixed some crashes during database creation.
  (partly by depending on the latest libgdamm).
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added Galician translation.
  (Ignacio Casal Quinteiro)

1.5.1 (unstable):

* Ported to libgdamm 3.0 and pygda-3.0 (from gnome-python-extras)
  Expect crashes and strange behaviour at first because might have missed something.
  But do tell us, so we can fix it.
  (Armin Burgmeier, Murray Cumming, Openismus)
* Start dialog: Show a list of recently-opened files, if any.
  (Armin Burgmeier, Openismus)
* Enable the relationships overview feature (using goocanvas).
* Button scripts and calculated fields:
  Show python errors and tracebacks in a dialog box.
  (Johannes Schmid, Openismus)
* Improved icons, in the correct sizes.
  (Andreas Nilsson)
* File format: More robust example rows format.
* Build: Removed unnecessary dependency on libgnomecanvasmm.

1.4.3:

* en_GB (British English) locale: Correct the parsing of 4-digit years in dates again.
  (This was fixed before 1.0 but broken again soon afterwards by a translator.)

1.4.2:

* Self-Hosting:
  - Add a password confirmation entry to the dialog that asks for the initial user name and password,
  and do some checking of the input.
  (Murray Cumming)
  - Make the connection work when the hostname is not resolved as 127.0.0.1, which might be a lot of people.
  (Mathias Hasselmann, Bug #420479)
  - Warn the user when the new directory would be the same as an existing one.
  (Murray Cumming, Mathias Hasselmann, Bug #420482)
  - Do not echo the new username and password to the terminal stdout for debugging.
  This was conceivably a security problem.
  (Murray Cumming)

1.4.1:

Minor build fix, needed by some compilers.

1.4.0:

What's new since Glom 1.2.0:

* Self-hosting: Databases can now be created in a local directory, without using a
  central PostgreSQL server. PostreSQL is still used to host the database on your
  local computer. You may, for instance, send an archive of this directory in an email.
  PostgreSQL is therefore now a non-optional dependency.
  In future, a client-only version of Glom might be available for embedded devices.
* Details view:
  - Related Records: Allow viewing of doubly-related records.
  - A vertical scrollbar now allows the window to be smaller when necessary
  on your screen.
* List View: Now supports static text items, static pictures, and script buttons, as
  the Details view already did.
* Field Formatting: Allow the user to remove a previously-chosen Also Show field.
  Bug #365051 from L Davison.
* Translations: Added Import and Export buttons, so you can use
  the standard .po format. (Johannes Schmid)
* Calculated Fields and Button Scripts: Now uses Python syntax highlighting, via GtkSourceView.
  (Johannes Schmid, Dodji Seketeli)
* Added Script Library to the Developer menu, for Python code that should be reused
  (via Import) in several scripts.
* Added --debug_sql commmand-line option, which prints out the generated
  SQL commands. (Johannes Schmid)
* Adapted for the latest Postgres version (and previous versions).
* Adapted for the latest Python version (and previous versions).
* Various bug-fixes, some of which are also in the Glom 1.2.x releases.

1.3.12 (unstable, but 1.4.0 will arrive soon)

* Users and Groups UI works with later versions of Postgres.
  (at least 8.2, and maybe >= 8.0 had this problem)
* Disabled experimental Avahi support because it was unstable
  and not yet doing anything useful.
  (Murray Cumming)

1.3.11 (unstable, but 1.4.0 will arrive soon)

* Self-Hosting: Fix a bug (in our hack) that prevented this from working on Ubuntu Feisty.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Details view: Remove the unwanted shadow/frame that was introduced when we added the
  vertical scrollbar.
  (Armin Burgmeier, bug 414260)
* List view: Allow script buttons to actually respond to clicks.
  (Armin Burgmeier, bug 359284)

1.3.10 (unstable)

* Connection: Try the additional 5434 network port used by Postgres 8.2
  on (current) versions of Ubuntu Feisty.
  See Ubuntu bug https://launchpad.net/bugs/86582
* Added code (currently disabled) to show a Relationships Overview diagram,
  using goocanvas. (Rasmus Toftdahl Olesen)

1.3.9 (unstable)

* At startup, double-check that PostgreSQL is really installed,
  and quit if it is not installed, or cannot be installed.
  The source code contains example code for Ubuntu to allow the
  user to install PostgreSQL at this time, though I would prefer
  that the user did not need to do a two-stage install,
  because self-hosting with PostgreSQL is not an optional feature.
  (That would be something for a cut-down client for embedded devices.)
  (Murray Cumming)

1.3.8 (unstable)

* Self-hosting:
  - Change the name of the sub-folder used to store self-hosted database data.
  - Discover an available network port number, instead of hard-coding the port number.
  - Experimental use of avahi: The self-hosting postgres instance is advertised via avahi,
    but you can't do anything useful with it.
* Details view: Add a vertical scrollbar, so that the window's minimum height is never too big
  for average screens.

1.3.7 (unstable):

* Build fixes for Python 2.5 and 64-bit systems, hopefully.

1.3.6 (unstable):

* Self-hosting: Now works in non-English locales.
  Bug #395511 from Aurelien.
* Field Formatting: Choices: Allow the user to remove a previously-chosen Also Show field.
  Bug #365051 from L Davison.
* List Layout: Allow fixed text, fixed images, and buttons on list rows.
* Require libgda 1.2.4, to avoid crashes with unusual characters in database and table names.

1.3.5 (unstable):

* Self-hosting of databases is now possible:
  - When you create a new database (from scratch, or by opening an example template),
  you will be asked whether you want to create it locally or on an external database server.
  If you create it locally then the database data will be contained in a local directory,
  and a separate postgres process will be started to host it.
  - When you open an existing .glom file, if it was created as self-hosting, then the data
  will be found and hosted automatically.
  - This is experimental, so please do report bugs. If you start from the terminal then you
  should see interesting debug output.
* Added help documentation for the connection error dialogs, with a link to the web page
  about setting up PostgreSQL.

1.3.4 (unstable):

* Related Records: Fix SQL error when sorting doubly-related records.

1.3.3 (unstable):

* Related Records: Allow viewing of records from doubly-related records.

1.3.2 (unstable):

* Developer menu: Add a Script Library.
  This allows you to add Python modules that can be imported by your buttons scripts
  or field calculations.
* Avoid relatively rare SQL errors about ambiguous fields and non-existant fields.
* Start dialog: Attempt to avoid strange line endings.
  Bug #369602 from Javier F. Serrador.
* Build:Partial Cygwin build fix.

1.3.1 (unstable):

* Translations: Add Import and Export buttons, so you can use
  the standard .po format. (Johannes Schmid)
* Connections: Don't bother trying alternative network ports
  after one port was successful. Bug #368787 from Craig Keogh.
* Find: Prevent SQL Errors when using capital letters in table and field names.
  Bug #375605 from William Manley.
* Button scripts and calculated fields: Code now uses Python syntax-highlighting
  colors, using GtkSourceView. (Johannes Schmid, Dodji Seketeli, Murray Cumming)
* Document:
  - Store scripts and other multi-line text in XML text nodes, instead
  of attributes, to be more compatible with other (non-libxml) XML parsers,
  such as Python's minidom.
  - Store the document format version in the document, warn when saving in
  a new format, and fail to load when the format version is too new.
* Added --debug-sql commmand-line option, which prints out the generated
  SQL commands. (Johannes Schmid, Murray Cumming)


1.2.0:

New features in Glom 1.2:

* Really remember the last-viewed record on the details view when navigating
  between tables.
* List view: Remember column widths when you resize them manually.
  Bug #358089 from Peter Williams.
* Related records:
  - When clicking the open button, show a warning dialog when the related
  record indicates a non-existant doubly-related record, making navigation
  impossible.
  - Allow navigation to doubly-related records (such as products from
  invoice lines on an invoice record), even when only the ID key is shown.
* Help buttons now work, though more help text is needed.
  (Johannes Schmid and Don Scorgie)

* Developer mode:
  - Added Add Related Table item to the Tables menu. This is a time-saving
    feature to quickly create a related table and a relationship to it,
    and is a first step to implementing further refactoring functionality.
    Bug #355975.
  - Field definitions: Warn about null values and non-unique values
    when setting a primary key.
  - Related records: Allow the developer to specify to what table the user
    will be taken, or use the automatic choice.
  - List views and related records portals:
    - Allow image fields in the lists.
    - When no fields are specified, show a hint about editing the layout.
    Bug #354073 from Peter Williams.
  - Python API (Calculated fields and button scripts):
    Added record.connection and record.table_name attributes, so you can
    go wild with SQL with the whole pygda API, if you must.
    The connection is even open already, you lucky people.
    See http://www.glom.org/wiki/index.php?title=Calculated_Fields_API#Using_the_full_pygda_API
    (Murray Cumming)
  - Button scripts: Update the view after the script has run, in case it
    changed any data.
  - Field Formatting: You can now specify a number of text lines to show for
    multi-line text. Bug #355907 from Peter Williams.
  - Layout editor dialogs: Added explanatory tooltips to the Add buttons.
  - Field calculation editor: Prevent translators from translating the
    fragment of python code.

Changes since 1.1.7:

* List view: Can now show image fields.
* Design: Fields: When marking a field as the primary key, avoid crashes
  and warn about null values and non-unique values in the field.

1.1.7:

* Button scripts: After the script has run, check that the current record
  still exists, and act appropriately.
* Related records portal: Correct the loading of the specific navigation
  details from the document, so it is not lost.
* Field editing: Fix modality problem with the field details window that
  stopped it from being used.
* Register Glom as capable of handling its own MIME type. (Denis Leroy)
* Make the Help system work, though some more text is still needed.
  Bug #349357
  (Johannes Schmid, Don Scorgie)

1.1.6:

* Really remember the last-viewed record on the details view when navigating
  between tables.
* Python API (Calculated fields and button scripts):

* List view: When remembering column widths, allow the columns to be
  resized smaller again. Bug #358089 from Peter Williams.
* Related Records:
  - Avoid a SQL error when showing a doubly-related field without showing
  the key field that is used in the relationship.
  - Allow the developer to specify to what table the user will be taken
  when clicking on the row button, or just use the automatic choice.
* Button scripts: Update the view after the script has run, in case it
  changed any data.

1.1.4:

* List view: Remember column widths when you resize them manually.
  Bug #358089 from Peter Williams.
* Find: Fix crash when searching on more than one field (an AND).
* Fixed some memory management problems.
  (Murray Cumming)

1.1.3:

* Added Add Related Table item to the Tables menu. This is a time-saving
  feature to quickly create a related table and a relationship to it,
  and is a first step to implementing further refactoring functionality.
  Bug #355975.
* Creating from examples: Correct a problem that could lead to Glom not
  using all the rows of example data.

1.1.2:

* Related records:
  - When clicking the open button, show a warning dialog when the related
  record indicates a non-existant doubly-related record, making navigation
  impossible.
  - Allow navigation to doubly-related records (such as products from
  invoice lines on an invoice record), even when only the ID key is shown.

1.1.1:

  fragment of python code.

1.0.5:

* Connection dialog: Use mnemonics for accessibility navigation.
  Bug #349357 from Ryan Paul.
* Details view: Date fields: Really save the new value when selecting dates from
  the calendar. Bug #349359. (Johannes Schmid).
* Design Tables: Allow table names to contain special characters such as -.
  (You will need a newer libgda to allow database names to contain these characters too.)
* Loading from examples: Handle quoted commas in the example data and reject badly
  formatted example data.
* Build:
  - Added disable-update-mime-database configure option is apparently helpful
  for distro packagers. Bug #351989. (Fryderyk Dziarmagowski)
  - Fixed warnings with gcc 4. Bug #344815. (Elijah Newren)

  - Updated Vietnamese translation (Clytie Siddall)

1.0.4:

* Related Records: When clicking the details buttons, just show the details, instead
  of flicking between details, list, and then details. That was annoying.
* List View:
  - When clicking Add, put the cursor in the appropriate column.
* Check for uniqueness before setting a value for a unique or primary-key field in the
  database.
* Calculations:
  - Allow the calculations to detect empty non-text fields, via the None object.
  - Recalculate calculations when a relationship's from key is changed, if that
  relationship is used in the calculation.
* In the Edit Tables dialog and Field Defintions dialog, do not double-click to open/edit,
  because this leads to awkwardsness/surprise because single click edits the cells too.
* Layout: Slight performance and positioning improvements.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Some more Windows/Cygwin build fixes. (Yselkowitz)
* Slightly (very slightly) more tango-like application icon. (Murray Cumming)

1.0.3:

* Fields: Prevent crash when adding field in non-English locale.
* Find:
  - Fix the [Find] button next to ID fields. It was wrongly saying that there
  were no results.
  - Really offer a second find when no results are found.
  - Show the busy cursor while finding.
* Layout: Really save changes of related records portal layouts and of custom
  field formatting.
* Some Windows/Cygwin build fixes.

1.0.2:

* Added a "..." (better suggestions welcome) next to date fields, to
  show a calendar dialog. New features like this should not be in the stable
  series, but this could help to solve a strange locale bug that someone is
  experiencing.

1.0.1:

* Correct failure while creating an example for the first time.
  (though it worked when you tried again.)
* Updated translations:
  - Finnish (Ilkka Tuohela)

* Details layouts and report:
  * Added Image layout part, for arbitrary images on the layout.
* Reports:
  * Added Header and Footer parts.
  * Show images.
  * Tell the user that the report will be opened in the browser, in case the
    browser is not at the front.

0.9.91

* Creating databases: Make sure that the user is in the developer group, even if he has never
  opened an example, allowing him to change his own database.
* Date fields:
 - Show and parse 4 digits for the year, even if the locale (stftime) stupidly thinks otherwise,
   though this need attention from translators in affected locales. Fixed for en_GB (Britain).
   Was not a problem for en_US or de_DE.
* Details layouts:
 - Fields with choices are no longer insensitive when read-only, so you can now,
   for instance, select and copy text out of them, or see what is in their menus.

0.9.9:

* Details layouts:
  - Added a Notebook layout part, with tabs, so the details can show more information,
    such as several related layouts portals.
  - Stop pictures and calculated values from existing records appearing on new empty records.
* View Layouts and Reports:
  - Allow doubly-related fields. For instance, Actor::Agent::name on the Details of a
    a Character record.
  - Add a Text layout part, for arbitrary text on the Details view, or reports.
* Reports:
  - Allow top-level fields in reports, for non-grouped-by reports.
  - Allow use of Group By parts without specified group-by fields, so they
    can be (mis)used just to specify a sort field for non-grouped-by records.
  - Allow Group By parts to be sorted by multiple fields, and allow the sort
    order (ascending or descending) to be specified.
  - Added Vertical Group report part, for packing more information into a row.
  - Allow adding of fields as siblings while selecting the field, instead of
    requiring the user to select the parent group.
  - Allow custom formatting of fields.
  - Allow a border width to be specified for the records table cells.
  - Added a horizontal line below group-by titles.

0.9.8:

* Lookups: Fix intermittent problem that caused looked-up values to
  not be stored in the database.
* Related Records: Correctly reload portal layouts that use related
  (from the related table) fields, rather than just fields in the related table.
* Performance: Avoid querying for some unnecessary fields on Details view.

0.9.7:

* When creating from a read-only example, really do not mark the saved file
  as not an example, and save the new database name, so you can open it
  again from the saved file.
* Prevent duplicate table, field, relationship, and report names,
  to prevent crashes.
* Field Definition:
  - Default Value tab renamed to Value.
  - Default Values and lookups are now grouped as
    User Entry and are mutually exclusive with Calculation.
  - When changing a calculation, all values will be recalculated,
    with a warning and the chance to cancel.
  - Fix crash when changing field type to number, when not all
    existing values are valid numbers.
  - Fix crashes when converting from text to boolean.
  - Fix crashes when converting from boolean to number.
  - Preserve information when converting from anything to boolean.
* Details and List Views: Do not allow editing of calculated fields.

  related choices.
* List View: Do not add a record when clicking on the Edit button on the last row
  - just go to the Details view.
* List layout: Warn that image fields are not supported on the
  list view yet.
* Date and Time Parsing improvements.
* New Translations:
  - Finnish (Ilkka Tuohela)
* Updated Translations:
  - Catalan (Josep Puigdemont)
  - Vietnamese (Clytie Siddall)

0.9.6:

* New built-in System Properties relationship:
  allows you to show fields from the system properties, such as
  the organisation's name and address, on a layout or report.
* The Field Layout Properties dialog (right-click on a field in
  developer mode to see the menu) now allows you to choose a custom title
  for the field for this instance, in case the regular field title is not
  appropriate. This is often the case for related fields.
* Save Field Layout Properties when the dialog closes. (Fixes a regression)
* Find:
  - Fix oddness in Details view when finding. (Fixes a regression)
  - Start Find mode on the current View, instead of always going to the Details view.
  - Find works again when you start on the Details view. (Fixes a regression)
  - Do a Find All if the find is not successful, if the user doesn't want to try again.
* Avoid python warnings when adding new records.
* Stop images from disappearing when refreshing layouts.

0.9.5:

* Details Layout:
  - Add Button layout item, to run arbitrary Python code, with access to
    the record data.
  - Fix bugs that caused the layout changes to be forgotten (regressions).
* Opening Examples:
  Do not open the Save As dialog box in the examples directory.
  Also see the latest Bakery (2.3.17) for fixes to prevent Save As in read-only paths.
* Build: Install the logo, for use by the Applications menu.

0.9.4:

* Relationships: Really save new relationships. (Fixes a regression.)
* Prevent crash when doing a lookup from a field of a different type, or via
  a relationship whose key fields are of different types.
* Prevent crashes when deleting field or relationships that are used on a layout.

0.9.3:

* Prevent crashes when using Table or Field names with uppercase characters.
* Translation:
  Added Translations menu item to Developer menu. Use this to specify
  translated table titles, field titles, layout part titles, report titles,
  etc, to be used when your Glom system is used in that locale.
* Prevent underscores from being interpreted as navigation markup in table
  and report titles.
* Performance improvements.
* The .desktop file can now be translated.
* New Translations:
  - Vietnamese (Clytie Siddall)
* Updated Translations:
  - Canadian English (Adam Weinberger)
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)

0.9.2:

* Examples:
  - When you open an example you must now always save an editable copy,
  and a new database will always be created on the server.
  - Examples contain example data to fill the new database.
  - Added File / Save As Example feature in developer mode.
* New files: Create the glom system tables, to avoid the error message.
* Find:
  Quick Find: Type criteria in this entry to search all text fields.
  Found Set: The number of found records and number of total records are now
  shown at the bottom right of the window, along with a Find All button.
* Added File / Export feature, for exporting comma-separated data.
* Image fields: Choosing clear from the context menu now really clears
  the field in the database.
* Updated Translations:
  - Canadian English (Adam Weinberger)
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)

0.9.1:

* List view: Show new records that were added in Details view.

* Updated Translations:
  - Canadian English (Adam Weinberger)
  - Catalan (Josep Puigdemont)
  - Czech (Miloslav Trmac)
  - German (Hendrik Brandt)
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)

0.9.0:

* Remembers last-viewed record and layout: If you view a record, then go
  to another table, then come back, the same record will be shown, on the
  same layout.
* Table title is now big and bold.
* Details view:
  -  ID fields that identify a unique related record (e.g. a Company ID on
  a contacts record) now have a Find button, so you can search for the
  related record, to get the ID.
  - When deleting a record, you will be asked for confirmation, as the
  list view already does. And when deleting the only record, the record
  will be blanked instead of still showing the dead record.
* Find:
  - Really searches for substrings.
  - Warns if no criteria was entered.
  - Warns if no records were found.

  - Instead of double-clicking to open record details, you can now click
  on the small Open button on each row.
* Details view:
  - ID fields that identify a unique related record (e.g. a Company ID on
  a contacts record) now have an Open button, so you can go quickly to
  the related record.

  well as the primary key.
* Details:
  - Related fields, with automatic related-record creation:
  Really write the new value into the related record, instead of
  just creating the related record.
  - The default layout is now more useful.
  - Field titles are now visible again when there is only one
  item in a multi-column group.
* Relationships: Create a suitable title when adding a
  relationship name.

  averages, and counts.
  - Group By parts may now show extra "secondary"
  fields, in addition to the field by which the records are
  grouped.
* Translations updated:
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)
  - Czech (Miloslav Trmac)
  - Canadian English (Adam Weinberger)
  - British English (Gareth Owen)

0.8.27:

* Simpler Tables menu replaces the Navigation/Tables
  dialog window.
* Added simple reports functionality, via the Reports
  menu.

0.8.26:

* For new databases, really allow the developer to create
  and edit records. This has probably been broken since

* Calculated fields: Do the calculations in the correct
  order of their dependencies.

0.8.24:

* Remove debug code that hardcoded one file path,
  so you can open any file.

0.8.23:

* Details and List:
  - Allow a drop-down list of choices for a field.
    Either a custom list, such as Mr, Ms, Mrs, Miss,
    or a list of related records, such as a list of
    product codes. This is demonstrated in the
    example, in the Invoices table.
- Details layout: Fields are now editable by default.
* Fixed various leaks and crashes, improved
  performance, and simplified the code some more.

0.8.22:

* Field Definitions:
  - Do not save empty default values as "NULL" or 0.
  - Prevent crash when opening Field details a second
    time.
  - Allow saving when the default value changes.
  - Calculated fields:
    - Simplified python API.
    - Aggregate calculations (sum, count, max, min)
      on related records.
    - Calculated fields may use the results of
      other calculated fields.
    - Do not lose digits after decimal points.
    (Demonstrated in the Invoice table in the example.)
* List:
  - Really do lookups and recalculations when
  adding new records.
* Details:
  - Related records: Only show related records, not
    all records.
* g++ 3.4 build fixes.
* Translations:
  - Updated Spanish (Francisco Javier Fernandez)


0.8.21:

* Calculated Fields: Your python function can now use
  the record's other field values. This requires
  the python libgda bindings in gnome-python-extras 2.11.
* List: Do lookups, and refresh related fields, when
  adding new records, not only when changing existing
  records.
* Details and Lists Layout: Field formatting is now in a
  separate dialog window.
* Boring Internals:
  - The List view's TreeModel now gets the data from the
  database dynamically on-demand, though it probably
  needs some more work to do that as efficiently as
  possible.
  - Now depends on pygtk and gnome-python-extras/libgda.
* Translations:
  Updated: Candadian English (Adam Weinberger),
  German (Hendrik Brandt), Czech (Miloslav Trmac)

0.8.20:

* Fix the boost::python build problem.
* Added highly experimental File/Print menu item. It
  does stuff in the Details view. It should open some
  HTML in your browser. glom installs an XSLT file
  used to create the HTML, so feel free to improve it.
* Translations: Added Kinyarwanda translation. (Steve Murphy)

0.8.19:

* List and Details: When defining the layout, developers
  can specify numeric formatting, such as decimal places,
  and currency symbols.
* Details: Related Records now use all available layout
  width, instead of having a fixed width.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Translations:
  - Pango markup and spaces not marked for translation.
    (Christian Rose)
  - Added Swedish (Christian Rose).
  - Updated Albanian (Laurent Dhima),
    Canadian English (Adam Weinberger),
    Czech (Miloslav Trmac),

0.8.18:

* The binary will be installed, fixing the problem in
  0.8.17. Sorry.

0.8.17:

* User/Groups Administration:
  Choosing the Developer/Users menu now allows you to
  create groups and specify view/edit/create/delete
  access rights for each table for each group.
* Developer mode: Now only possible for users who are in
  the developer group.
* Details view: You can now right-click on a field to add
  a field, group, or related records.
* Ignore pga_* tables created by pgadmin.

0.8.16:

* Relationships:
  -  Allow the developer to specify whether related records
  should be created automatically.
  - Do not clear the To Field column when the user clicks on it.
* Details/List views:
  - Automatic creation of related records:
  When you enter a value in a related field, when their is
  not yet a key value to identify the related record, a
  record can be create automatically, and the key value
  will be filled in for you.
  - Developers may set fields on the layout as non-editable.


0.8.15:

* Related Fields:
  Details and List views can now show fields from related records.
  Just choose the relationship when you choose the field on
  the layout. This even works in Related Records portals.
* Non-editable fields:
  When choosing a field for a layout, you can specify whether
  editing of the field should be allowed.
* Dialogs are more HIG-compliant, using secondary text.
* Now requires gtkmm 2.6 instead of 2.4.

0.8.14:

* Details View: Adding records works even when a field appears
  more than once in the layout.
* List View: Deleting records works again.

0.8.13:

* Details:
  - Related Records now work, including automatic addition of new
    related records.
  - In developer mode, you can right-click on fields to choose a
    different field.
  - In developer mode, you can right-click on related records to
    choose a different relationship and choose the fields to show.
  - Groups may now contain the same field more than once.
* Details and List: Automatically-generated primary keys do not
  need to be displayed.
* List: Avoid GTK+ warning when clicking on empty space in the
  TreeView.
* Example:
  - Make some fields lookup their data from relationships:
    Invoice Lines gets product information from the products table,
    and Invoices looksup the customer name from the contacts table.
  - Warn if people recreate a database on the server from a
    read-only example file, because they will probably want to
    change things.

0.8.12:

* Postgres connection:
  - Really use the template1 database when creating new databases.
  - Slightly better error handling.
* Obscure internals:
  - Use a custom GdaValue-based treemodel for the List view,
    allowing us to get data on-demand in future.

0.8.11:

* Postgres connection:
  - Connect to the template1 database when creating new databases,
    because recent (?) versions of postgres require this.
  - Don't ignore the host name.
  - Added postgres_setup.txt and a non-libgda test to help
    investigate connection problems.
  - Share connections more, without re-connecting, to increase speed.
* List Layout:
  - Fix bug that prevented data entry of fields that have
    human-readable titles.
* Layout Design:
  - Fix loss of layout groups when loading.
  - Allow adding of related records (half-finished) in the
    middle of the layout, and no longer show them automatically
    in a notebook.
    (It's really time to make this feel like glade.)
* Navigation:
  - Show table titles instead of name when in Operator mode.
* Build:
  - Distribute the intltool files.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162932 (Cezar)
  - #include libintl.h in more files, required on some systems.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162932 (Mike Castle)
  - Fix Glib::wrap() build error with gcc 3.4.3.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160245 (Christian Krause)

0.8.10:

* Added an example document.
* Offer to create databases on the server based on documents,
  such as examples.
* Don't display empty dates, times, and numbers as "NULL".
* Specify empty dates and times to server in SQL as "NULL", not
  as empty strings.
* Dialogs have default buttons.
* Avoided a few crashes.

0.8.9:

* Really save details of new tables in the document.
* Create the tables inside the specified database, instead of
  putting them all in the user's default postgress database.
* Enforce one database per document - ask for a new database name
  when creating a new document instead of allowing the user
  to choose an existing database.
* When there is still only one table, open it without asking the
  user to choose a table, as if it is the default table.
* Show the database title in the window title bar, instead of
  the filename.
(Murray Cumming)
* Fix an internationalization build problem. (Mike Castle)

0.8.8:

* Details Layout: Simpler, hierarchical layout. This allows
  more complex layouts, and allows fields to appear more than
  once on the same layout.
* Documentation: Added user manual, though it looks a
  bit strange in yelp at the moment.
* Relationships:
  - Avoid crash when fields of differerent types are used in
  relationships.
  - Actually delete relationships when the delete button is pressed.

0.8.7:

* Field Definition:
  - Add Boolean field type, which is displayed as a checkbox.
  - Default values can be the result of python calculations.
  - Default values are validated according to the field type.
* Pressing cancel on the initial dialog closes the application.
* Details view:
  - Corrected widget layout problems.
  - Do not lose the layout groups after a while.
  - Fix crash when changing user level, with related records.
(Murray Cumming)
* Added Albanian translation. (Laurent Dhima)

0.8.6:

* Creating new documents works again.
* Auto-save documents, when in developer mode,
  instead of asking.
* Navigation:
  - Database: Default to the linux user name.
  - Tables: Show the hidden status correctly.

0.8.5:

* Data Details: Editing works again.
* Find mode now works, though it's simple.
* Edit buttons are now stock Open buttons.
* Renaming of tables: The new names are stored in the
  document so you can rename again, and use the renamed table.

* Data Details: Groups of fields are now shown together in a HIG-style frame.
* Design: field, table, and layout group titles now have defaults, by replacing white space and
  capitalizing.
* Some build improvements.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added Portugese translation (Duarte Loreto)

0.8.2:

* Navigation / Tables : Fixed focus bug when adding tables.
* Fields can lookup their values from a field in
  another table via a relationship.
* When a table is marked as the default then it will be
  opened automatically when the database is opened.
* Tables can now be renamed.
* List and Data views: Auto-increment fields are non-editable.
* Update the Data view when field editing has finished.
* Code cleanup: AddDel widget is now iterator-based.
(Murray Cumming)
* Czech translation. (Miloslav Trmac)
* Dutch translation. (Tino Meinen)


0.8.1:

* Details and List views: Dates, times, and numbers are now displayed
  and parsed according to the current locale.
  (Murray Cumming, Daniel Elstner)
* Removed Design Mode - Added items to the Developer menu instead.
* Details view: The entry widgets for Date, time, and number fields now
  have more suitable widths, so it looks nicer.
* User Level is now per-document (or per-instance) instead of per-application.
* The User Level is forced to Operator if the document is read-only.
* Do not show the help text because it's annoying.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added internationalization support, with the following translations:
  Italian (Alberto Paro)
  German (Hendrik Brandt)
  Canadian English (Adam Weinberger)
  Brazilian Portugese (Gustavo Noronha Silva)
  Swedish (Christian Rose)

* Now use libglademm to allow more improvement of the UI.
* Glom can no longer be used with database tables that it did not create.

* Added "User Level" - normal operators do not see design functionality.
  User Levels are bad, but this seems to be the only way to present the
  design functionality next to the stuff being designed.
* Allows simple layout of List and Details views. (grouping in the Details view is not yet fully implemented)
* Saves all field information in the document.
* Tables can be hidden from normal users.
