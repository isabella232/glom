  (Murray Cumming)

1.25.6 (unstable):

  (Murray Cumming)

1.25.5 (unstable):

* Check that we have the pg_config utility.

* Avoid the glib warning about adding interfaces after class initialization.
  (And therefore require a recent glibmm.)
  (Murray Cumming)
* Fix the build and tests with python 3.
  You'll need to do something like this:
    export PYTHON=python3.3
      (do this before starting jhbuild, if you are using jhbuild).
    configure --with-boost-python=boost_python-mt-py33
      (or autogen.sh if building from git.)
    You will also need to have built pygobject with Python3 support.
  (Murray Cumming)

  It puts libpython2.7 in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ .
* Reduce the libgda dependency version again.

1.23.3 (unstable):

  as with the existing --enable-sqlite configure option.
  The MySQL support is very experimental and unsupported.
  It might be removed later if nobody chooses to work on it.
* libglom: Added a dependency on libgda-mysql-5.0, because
  libglom always supports all backends regardless of the build
  option.

  - Save static image data as a child text node, not an attribute.
  - Save image data (example data or static images) in base64 format,
    instead of the GDA format.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Export to po files:
  - Also export static text items, and print layouts.
  - Avoid duplicates.
    (Murray Cumming)
* Examples: Add a static image item to the Project Manager example.
  This is just so that the feature gets some testing.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Tests: Add new tests using GdkPixbufLoader to check that we can interpret
	image data as an image.
  (Murray Cumming)

1.22.1 (stable):

* Self hosting:
  - Do not allow ident authorization.
    We use trust instead when not sharing.
  - Only allow attempts from localhost when not shared.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Film Manager example: Correct the Contacts reports.
  (Murray Cumming)

Build:

  run make check as a sanity check.
* Windows build: Fix some typos.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #674009 (alien)
* OpenBSD: std:cerr needs <iostream>.
  (Antoine Jacoutot) Bug #673914

* libglom: LayoutItem_GroupBy: Add get and set methods for members.

1.21.6 (unstable):

* Make auto-increment fields work even if they are not primary keys.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #661702
* Do not hide the database structure if the user does not have view rights,
  and prevent SQL errors in that case.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #669299
* Allow printing of print layouts from the List view too, to avoid confusion.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #670462 (alien)
* Print Layout: Avoid sometimes over-scaled images.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #668901 (alien)
* Users/Groups:
  - Example files: Really load the table privileges.
  - Really prevent changing to developer mode for non-developers.
    Bug #669043 (alien)
  - Allow user and group names to have spaces and other special characters.
    Bug #669012 (alien)
  - Limit user and group name lengths because PostgreSQL seems to have an
    (undocumented) limit.
  - Warn if we cannot get the list of users. Bug #669178 (alien)
  - Add tests.
    (Murray Cumming)
* Button scripts: Check and warn about pygtk2 instead of crashing.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #669196 (alien) and ##661766 (Andre Klapper) .
* ReportBuilder:
  - Make summary fields work again.

  (Murray Cumming) Bug #668759 (alien).
* Document: Avoid accumulating old nodes in the XML.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Examples: Remove empty group in the Lesson Planner example file.
  (Ben Konrath) Bug #671263
* libglom: Glom::Utils::get_find_where_clause_quick(): Handle an empty value properly.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Use Gtk::Application and Gtk::ApplicationWindow instead of Gtk::Main.
  So far this does not change anything whatosever for the user,
  though --help now doesn't list all options by default.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Windows build fixes (not complete).
  (Murray Cumming) Bug ##671120 (alien), Bug #670903 (alien)

1.21.5 (unstable):

* Depend on libgda 5.0.3 because we need the GdaNumeric corrections.
  This avoids errors when creating from examples, when using a 
  non-English locale. This fixes bug #668346 (Janne)

1.21.4 (unstable):

* libglom: Use std::vector instead of std::list, for consistency.
* Translations:
  - Allow the database title to be translated.
  - Default to en rather than en_US for the original locale.

1.21.3 (unstable):

* libglom: TranslatableItem: Require the caller to provide the locale to 
  get_title() instead of calling the static set_current_locale() method
  (now removed). This allows Online Glom to use translations, and it is 
  generally good to avoid the static data.
  
1.21.2 (unstable):

* Field choices:
  - Allow custom (not related) choices to be translated,
  with only the original text being stored in the database.
  This only happens when the choices are restricted, at least for now.
  - Use the appropriate type of data for choices. rather than, for instance,
  forcing German users to see (and store) 1.99 EUR instead of 1,99 EUR.
* Translations:
  - Offer non-country locales, such as de, instead of only de_DE, de_AT, etc.
  - Default to the first locale in the list, instead of none.
* Added command-line utilities to help with translation via po files:
  glom_export_po, glom_import_po, glom_export_po_all.
* Build: Added several more tests, including tests of the translation system
  and of the iso-codes XML files parsing.

1.21.1 (unstable):

* Details: Foreign key ID fields: Add a New button next to 
  the existing Find button.
* Related Choices: Allow the user to specify a sort order.
* libglom:
  - Make libglom 1.22 parallel installable with glom 1.20.
  - Document: Added get_translation_available_locales().
  - Field: Remove unused get_gda_holder_string().
  - Remove unused get_sql_format() methods.
  - DbUtils:: Added get_fields_for_table(), 
    get_fields_for_table_one_field(), get_lookup_fields(), and 
    get_lookup_value()
  - LayoutGroup:
    - Add a 
    remove_field(parent_table_name, table_name, field_name) 
    method overload, deprecating the existing method overloads.
    - Deprecate the old has_field() method and do not use it.
  - Remove unused parameternamegenerator.[h|cc] source files.
* Build:
  - Avoid deprecated glibmm API
(Murray Cumming)

  (Murray Cumming)
* Edit menu: Make the Cut/Copy/Paste menus actually work.
  (David King, Murray Cumming) Bug #518315 (Göran)

  The sort order can be specified in Glom 1.21/22.
* libglom: Document_XML: Remove an unimplemented method.
  Bug #666744 (yselkowitz)

1.20.3 (stable):

* Details: ID Find button: Really show the quick find feature.
* List: Really store data when the primary key is not auto-incremented.
* Add the glom_test_connection command-line tool.
* Film Manager example: Use English for Day/Night choices.

1.20.2 (stable):

* Correct parsing of quotes in example data.
* ComboBoxes: Work around GtkComboBoxText bug #612396.
  This fixes the Users/Groups dialogs and the Script Library dialog.
* libglom: DbUtils::recreate_database_from_document():
  Create groups and set table privileges too.
* More tests.

1.20.1 (stable):

* Avoid some unnecessary stdout warnings.
* Tests:
  - Added several more tests and improved existing tests.
  - Added gcov/lcov to generate test code coverage reports in HTML.
    (make gcov)

* libglom:
  - LayoutGroup: Added a remove_field(parent_table_name, table_name, field_name) 
    method overload.
  - LayoutGroup: Added a has_field(parent_table_name, table_name, field_name) 
    method overload.
  - Added DbUtils::set_fake_connection().

This is the master branch. See also the glom-1-20 branch.

2011-11-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	libglom: Added DbUtils::set_fake_connection().

	* glom/libglom/db_utils.[h|cc]: Added DbUtils::set_fake_connection()
  because ConnectionPool is not public API.

* Use the new Gtk::ComboBox CellArea API to align columns properly.
* Build:
  - Depend on libgdamm-5.0 instead of libgdamm-4.0.
  - Remove the dependency on pygda, though we now check for
    gi.repository.Gda at startup instead.
    It is provided by libgda-5.0 (currently 4.99.x).
  - Require the latest mm-common and dist the mm-common scripts.
  - Require the latest gtksourceviewmm

    now active again.
  - Call xmlCleanupParser() because libxml++ does not anywmore.
    (Murray Cumming)

1.19.1 (unstable):

* Choices: Allow multiple extra fields, and allow them to be related fields
  or even doubly-related fields.
  See http://www.murrayc.com/blog/permalink/2010/10/07/glom-choice-drop-downs-can-show-related-fields/
* Added a --stop-auto-server-shutdown command-line option for debugging.

  (Armin Burgeier)
* Build: Fix the python module's filename.
(Murray Cumming)

1.16.0 (stable):

New features in Glom 1.16, compared to Glom 1.14:

* Field Formatting: Related Choices: Add a Show All checkbox, so that
  the list of choices can be restricted according to the relationship,
  instead of just showing all values in the related table.
  This allows the Choices to be used to narrow down a choice based on a
  choice in another field.
* Developer menu: Added Export Backup and Restore Backup menu items.
  These use PostgreSQL's pg_dump and pg_restore utilities, wrapping the
  dump and .glom file up in a .tar.gz.
  As well as allowing backups of data, this should make it easier to upgrade
  the PostgreSQL version, which some distros do automatically when upgrading
  to new major versions of Glom. This is possible because pg_restore can
  work with the pg_dump output of an older PostgreSQL version.

  choice in another field.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #625536 (fmyhr)
* Allow unique fields with same name in multiple tables.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #625192 (fmyhr).

    Suggested by Mathias Hasselmann.
  - Add a horizontal alignment option, though we still right-align numbers
    by default. Bug #591125 (Patrick Chan)
  - Allow choices to be shown as radio buttons instead of a drop-down combo box.
    Requested by Frederik Vande Rieviere.
* Many small UI improvements.
* Field calculations and button scripts:
  - Fields values may now be changed like so:

  This release is to give disto packagers a chance to cope with that.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Fix Maemo build errors
  (Peter Penz)
  (This fix is also in glom 1.2. The boost::python dependency will make

  foreground color and background color) for static text items and buttons.
  (Murray Cumming)

1.13.1 (unstable):

* Details and List layouts:
  Allow custom formatting of static text and buttons instead of just fields.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Field Formatting:
  - Add the option to use a different text color for negative values.
    (suggested by Mathias Hasselmann)
  - Add a horizontal alignment option, though we still right-align numbers
    by default. #591125 (Patrick Chan)

  (Michael Hasselmann)


1.12.0 (stable):

What's new in Glom 1.12:

* Really save field definition changes again.
  Ubuntu Launchpad bug
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glom/+bug/394507 (elmergato)
* Allow table and field names to use uppercase characters.
  (requires the latest libgda - either libgda 4.0.4 or libgda 4.1.2.)
  Bug #587051
* Do not fail too soon when self-starting a PostgreSQL instance, though the
  time to wait until PostgreSQL should be ready is still a hard-coded number.
* Export:
  - Correct the export to use the CSV specification
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glom/+bug/394894 elmergato)
  - Don't open the format dialog behind the FileChooser dialog.
    Ubuntu Launchpad bug
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glom/+bug/397409 (elmergato)

  - Remove any client-only or PostgreSQL/SQLite ifdefs, so that libglom always
    offers all functionality, to avoid the need to have multiple versions of
    libglom installed if you have multiple Glom builds installed. Only the
    no-exceptions build option remains, because they will never be on the same
    system.
  - Remove any Maemo-specific ifdefs because libglom is non-UI.
  - Fix the pkg-config .pc file.
  - Avoid calling g_thread_init() twice, fixing a crash.

  (Johannes Schmid)
* When cancelling the initial dialog, fix the strange behaviour.
  (Johannes Schmid) Bug #569721.
* Main window: Correct the order of the widgets at the bottom-right that
  show the number of found records and the total number of records.
  (Murray Cumming)
* List view, Related Records lists:
  Really show lookup values and related fields.
  This regression was introduce in Glom 1.8, now fixed.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #569722 (Johannes Schmid)


1.9.0: (unstable)

* Ported to libgdamm-4.0 (libgda-4.0) from libgda(mm)-3.0.
  (Johannes Schmid, Armin Burgmeier, Murray Cumming)
* Initial sqlite support as an alternative to PostgreSQL, intended for
  embedded use. There are still some obvious problems with this, but we
  expect to solve them soon in the next release, when we will also make this
  only a configure option.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* Find: Make find mode work again in the list view.
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #565579
* Cache the connection for a few seconds to avoid unnecessary reconnects,
  making things faster. (Murray Cumming)
* Fixes from recent 1.8 releases.

1.8.1:

* Related records: Show the specified fields, not all fields.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Fix the client-only build.
  (Koop Mast) Bug #557258

Glom 1.8

Major changes since 1.6:

New features:
* Import: Comma-separated data may now be imported into the
  current table, with the help of an assistant to choose the
  field mapping.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* Drag and Drop layout: Drag the layout items from the toolbar,
  or drag items to move them around the layout.
  (This feature may still have some bugs. The old layout window
   is still the default.)
  (Johannes Schmid)
* Print Layouts: precise layout of print outs for record details.
  (This feature is not really complete yet. The old HTML output
   is still available.)
  (Murray Cumming)
* Calendar Portal: See related records via a calendar, choosing
  one field to use for the date, and other fields to show on that
  day in the calendar.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Network sharing: Open running Glom systems via the network,
  without opening the file from the file system.
  (Murray Cumming, Mathias Hasselmann)
* New clearer initial dialog.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* Layout: You may now choose a custom font, foreground color
  and background color for fields.
  (Murray Cumming)
* List Layout: Column widths may now be specified.
  (Murray Cumming)
* An installer for MS Windows is now available.
  (Armin Burgmeier)

Build changes:
* Removed libgnome(mm) dependency.
* Removed gnome-vfs(mm) dependency, using gio(mm) instead.
* Now uses bakery-2.6 instead of bakery-2.4.
* Added dependencies on libepc and goocanvasmm.


1.7.3:

* Print Layout: Fields can now be specified for related records
  portals, and their data appears in the printout, though the
  whole Print Layout feature is still rather unfinished.
* Print Layout list: Add a default title when adding a print layout.
* Related Records layout: Fix a bug that was introduced some time
  during 1.7.x, preventing static text and images from being added.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Drag and Drop layout: Add a related records toolbar item, to add
  portals to the layout.

1.7.2:

* Drag-and-drop Layout:
  - Hide the toolbar by default, because this feature is still
  not ready. Added a menu item to show it.
  - Added tooltips to the toolbar items.
  (Johannes Schmid)
* List Layout:
  - Allow the user to specify column widths.
  - Hide the Groups Columns column for list layouts.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Print Layout: More improvements though this is still not ready.
  - Use the same EggToolPallette toolbar as the drag-and-drop layout.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Build: Fixed a const problem with gtkmm 2.12.
* Improvements for the Windows port:
  - Check that the user is not admin (like root on Linux),
    because that would be a network security risk, and postgres
    checks too.
  - Hide the console windows when starting postgres, by using
    CreateProcess() instead of Glib::spawn().
  - Deal with some IO strangeness.
  - Initialize WinSock at startup so we can find an unused port.
  - Added the installer source files to svn.
  - Initial dialog: Hide the network item, because we do not have
    Avahi on Windows.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* Client-only (Maemo) build:
  - Fix the build.
  - Intial Dialog: Hide the Create Database tab.
  (Johannes Schmid)
* Removed translatable property from stock labels in the glade file.
  (Claude Paroz)

Changes in 1.7.1:

New features since 1.6:
* Redesigned initial dialog.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* Advertize running Glom systems on the network via Avahi and allow
  other users to browse for them and open them. Uses libepc.
  (Murray Cumming, Mathias Hasselmann)
* New Import feature, to import comma-separated rows of data into the
  current table.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* (Unfinished) drag-and-drop of layout items from a toolbar, and
  right-clicking to edit item details.
  For now, you will still need the layout dialog too.
  (Johannes Schmid)
* (Unfinished) exact-layout print layout feature, for instance for
  printing out invoices or for printing on pre-printed forms.
  (Murray Cumming)
* New Calendar portal, to view related records on a calendar, using
  one of the related records' fields as the date.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Custom font, foreground color and background color for fields.
  (Murray Cumming)

Other changes:
* Field Definitions: Refuse to change a field name to one that
  already exists.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Initial Windows port.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* Some optimization for very large tables, and some memory leak fixes,
  though really fast-enough performance must wait until we port to
  libgda 4.0.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added : at the end of labels, as per the GNOME HIG.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Remove sentences saying that names should not have spaces or
  special characters, because they can.
  Bug #528209 (Jean-François Fortin Tam)
* Hopefully allow bug-buddy and aport to work.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Reimplemented the Relationships Overview graph dialog.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Code refactoring to make it easier to add new layout items.
  (Murray Cumming, Armin Burgmeier)
* Removed libgnome dependency, by adding a hack for showing help.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* Port to giomm instead of gnome-vfsmm (also in Bakery).
* gcc 4.3 build fixes.
  (Jeremiah Savage) Bug #529530.

Changes in 1.6:

glom 1.6 has only minor user-visible changes compared to glom 1.4:

* New relationships Overview diagram, available via the Developers menu.
  (Rasmus Toftdahl Olesen)
* Start dialog now shows recently-opened files.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* Button scripts and calculated fields now show python errors
  and tracebacks in a dialog box.
  (Johannes Schmid)
* Ported to libgdamm 3.0.
  (Murray Cumming, Armin Burgmeier)
* Now ignores previously-set multiline text formatting
  options for non-text fields.  Bug #443360 (Harry Mills)
  (Murray Cumming)

1.6.0 (stable)

* Depend on latest libgdamm, to fix handling of dates.
* Slightly improved handling of database server errors.

1.5.3 (unstable)

* Avoid unnecessary unsaved-changes warning dialogs.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Ignore previously-set multiline text formatting
  options for non-text fields,
  Bug #443360 (Harry Mills)
  (Murray Cumming)

1.5.2 (unstable)

* Fixed some crashes during database creation.
  (partly by depending on the latest libgdamm).
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added Galician translation.
  (Ignacio Casal Quinteiro)

1.5.1 (unstable):

* Ported to libgdamm 3.0 and pygda-3.0 (from gnome-python-extras)
  Expect crashes and strange behaviour at first because might have missed something.
  But do tell us, so we can fix it.
  (Armin Burgmeier, Murray Cumming, Openismus)
* Start dialog: Show a list of recently-opened files, if any.
  (Armin Burgmeier, Openismus)
* Enable the relationships overview feature (using goocanvas).
* Button scripts and calculated fields:
  Show python errors and tracebacks in a dialog box.
  (Johannes Schmid, Openismus)
* Improved icons, in the correct sizes.
  (Andreas Nilsson)
* File format: More robust example rows format.
* Build: Removed unnecessary dependency on libgnomecanvasmm.

1.4.3:

* en_GB (British English) locale: Correct the parsing of 4-digit years in dates again.
  (This was fixed before 1.0 but broken again soon afterwards by a translator.)

1.4.2:

* Self-Hosting:
  - Add a password confirmation entry to the dialog that asks for the initial user name and password,
  and do some checking of the input.
  (Murray Cumming)
  - Make the connection work when the hostname is not resolved as 127.0.0.1, which might be a lot of people.
  (Mathias Hasselmann, Bug #420479)
  - Warn the user when the new directory would be the same as an existing one.
  (Murray Cumming, Mathias Hasselmann, Bug #420482)
  - Do not echo the new username and password to the terminal stdout for debugging.
  This was conceivably a security problem.
  (Murray Cumming)

1.4.1:

Minor build fix, needed by some compilers.

1.4.0:

What's new since Glom 1.2.0:

* Self-hosting: Databases can now be created in a local directory, without using a
  central PostgreSQL server. PostreSQL is still used to host the database on your
  local computer. You may, for instance, send an archive of this directory in an email.
  PostgreSQL is therefore now a non-optional dependency.
  In future, a client-only version of Glom might be available for embedded devices.
* Details view:
  - Related Records: Allow viewing of doubly-related records.
  - A vertical scrollbar now allows the window to be smaller when necessary
  on your screen.
* List View: Now supports static text items, static pictures, and script buttons, as
  the Details view already did.
* Field Formatting: Allow the user to remove a previously-chosen Also Show field.
  Bug #365051 from L Davison.
* Translations: Added Import and Export buttons, so you can use
  the standard .po format. (Johannes Schmid)
* Calculated Fields and Button Scripts: Now uses Python syntax highlighting, via GtkSourceView.
  (Johannes Schmid, Dodji Seketeli)
* Added Script Library to the Developer menu, for Python code that should be reused
  (via Import) in several scripts.
* Added --debug_sql commmand-line option, which prints out the generated
  SQL commands. (Johannes Schmid)
* Adapted for the latest Postgres version (and previous versions).
* Adapted for the latest Python version (and previous versions).
* Various bug-fixes, some of which are also in the Glom 1.2.x releases.

1.3.12 (unstable, but 1.4.0 will arrive soon)

* Users and Groups UI works with later versions of Postgres.
  (at least 8.2, and maybe >= 8.0 had this problem)
* Disabled experimental Avahi support because it was unstable
  and not yet doing anything useful.
  (Murray Cumming)

1.3.11 (unstable, but 1.4.0 will arrive soon)

* Self-Hosting: Fix a bug (in our hack) that prevented this from working on Ubuntu Feisty.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Details view: Remove the unwanted shadow/frame that was introduced when we added the
  vertical scrollbar.
  (Armin Burgmeier, bug 414260)
* List view: Allow script buttons to actually respond to clicks.
  (Armin Burgmeier, bug 359284)

1.3.10 (unstable)

* Connection: Try the additional 5434 network port used by Postgres 8.2
  on (current) versions of Ubuntu Feisty.
  See Ubuntu bug https://launchpad.net/bugs/86582
* Added code (currently disabled) to show a Relationships Overview diagram,
  using goocanvas. (Rasmus Toftdahl Olesen)

1.3.9 (unstable)

* At startup, double-check that PostgreSQL is really installed,
  and quit if it is not installed, or cannot be installed.
  The source code contains example code for Ubuntu to allow the
  user to install PostgreSQL at this time, though I would prefer
  that the user did not need to do a two-stage install,
  because self-hosting with PostgreSQL is not an optional feature.
  (That would be something for a cut-down client for embedded devices.)
  (Murray Cumming)

1.3.8 (unstable)

* Self-hosting:
  - Change the name of the sub-folder used to store self-hosted database data.
  - Discover an available network port number, instead of hard-coding the port number.
  - Experimental use of avahi: The self-hosting postgres instance is advertised via avahi,
    but you can't do anything useful with it.
* Details view: Add a vertical scrollbar, so that the window's minimum height is never too big
  for average screens.

1.3.7 (unstable):

* Build fixes for Python 2.5 and 64-bit systems, hopefully.

1.3.6 (unstable):

* Self-hosting: Now works in non-English locales.
  Bug #395511 from Aurelien.
* Field Formatting: Choices: Allow the user to remove a previously-chosen Also Show field.
  Bug #365051 from L Davison.
* List Layout: Allow fixed text, fixed images, and buttons on list rows.
* Require libgda 1.2.4, to avoid crashes with unusual characters in database and table names.

1.3.5 (unstable):

* Self-hosting of databases is now possible:
  - When you create a new database (from scratch, or by opening an example template),
  you will be asked whether you want to create it locally or on an external database server.
  If you create it locally then the database data will be contained in a local directory,
  and a separate postgres process will be started to host it.
  - When you open an existing .glom file, if it was created as self-hosting, then the data
  will be found and hosted automatically.
  - This is experimental, so please do report bugs. If you start from the terminal then you
  should see interesting debug output.
* Added help documentation for the connection error dialogs, with a link to the web page
  about setting up PostgreSQL.

1.3.4 (unstable):

* Related Records: Fix SQL error when sorting doubly-related records.

1.3.3 (unstable):

* Related Records: Allow viewing of records from doubly-related records.

1.3.2 (unstable):

* Developer menu: Add a Script Library.
  This allows you to add Python modules that can be imported by your buttons scripts
  or field calculations.
* Avoid relatively rare SQL errors about ambiguous fields and non-existant fields.
* Start dialog: Attempt to avoid strange line endings.
  Bug #369602 from Javier F. Serrador.
* Build:Partial Cygwin build fix.

1.3.1 (unstable):

* Translations: Add Import and Export buttons, so you can use
  the standard .po format. (Johannes Schmid)
* Connections: Don't bother trying alternative network ports
  after one port was successful. Bug #368787 from Craig Keogh.
* Find: Prevent SQL Errors when using capital letters in table and field names.
  Bug #375605 from William Manley.
* Button scripts and calculated fields: Code now uses Python syntax-highlighting
  colors, using GtkSourceView. (Johannes Schmid, Dodji Seketeli, Murray Cumming)
* Document:
  - Store scripts and other multi-line text in XML text nodes, instead
  of attributes, to be more compatible with other (non-libxml) XML parsers,
  such as Python's minidom.
  - Store the document format version in the document, warn when saving in
  a new format, and fail to load when the format version is too new.
* Added --debug-sql commmand-line option, which prints out the generated
  SQL commands. (Johannes Schmid, Murray Cumming)


1.2.0:

New features in Glom 1.2:

* Really remember the last-viewed record on the details view when navigating
  between tables.
* List view: Remember column widths when you resize them manually.
  Bug #358089 from Peter Williams.
* Related records:
  - When clicking the open button, show a warning dialog when the related
  record indicates a non-existant doubly-related record, making navigation
  impossible.
  - Allow navigation to doubly-related records (such as products from
  invoice lines on an invoice record), even when only the ID key is shown.
* Help buttons now work, though more help text is needed.
  (Johannes Schmid and Don Scorgie)

* Developer mode:
  - Added Add Related Table item to the Tables menu. This is a time-saving
    feature to quickly create a related table and a relationship to it,
    and is a first step to implementing further refactoring functionality.
    Bug #355975.
  - Field definitions: Warn about null values and non-unique values
    when setting a primary key.
  - Related records: Allow the developer to specify to what table the user
    will be taken, or use the automatic choice.
  - List views and related records portals:
    - Allow image fields in the lists.
    - When no fields are specified, show a hint about editing the layout.
    Bug #354073 from Peter Williams.
  - Python API (Calculated fields and button scripts):
    Added record.connection and record.table_name attributes, so you can
    go wild with SQL with the whole pygda API, if you must.
    The connection is even open already, you lucky people.
    See http://www.glom.org/wiki/index.php?title=Calculated_Fields_API#Using_the_full_pygda_API
    (Murray Cumming)
  - Button scripts: Update the view after the script has run, in case it
    changed any data.
  - Field Formatting: You can now specify a number of text lines to show for
    multi-line text. Bug #355907 from Peter Williams.
  - Layout editor dialogs: Added explanatory tooltips to the Add buttons.
  - Field calculation editor: Prevent translators from translating the
    fragment of python code.

Changes since 1.1.7:

* List view: Can now show image fields.
* Design: Fields: When marking a field as the primary key, avoid crashes
  and warn about null values and non-unique values in the field.

1.1.7:

* Button scripts: After the script has run, check that the current record
  still exists, and act appropriately.
* Related records portal: Correct the loading of the specific navigation
  details from the document, so it is not lost.
* Field editing: Fix modality problem with the field details window that
  stopped it from being used.
* Register Glom as capable of handling its own MIME type. (Denis Leroy)
* Make the Help system work, though some more text is still needed.
  Bug #349357
  (Johannes Schmid, Don Scorgie)

1.1.6:

* Really remember the last-viewed record on the details view when navigating
  between tables.
* Python API (Calculated fields and button scripts):
  Added record.connection and record.table_name attributes, so you can
  go wild with SQL with the whole pygda API, if you must.
  The connection is even open already, you lucky people.
  See http://www.glom.org/wiki/index.php?title=Calculated_Fields_API#Using_the_full_pygda_API
  (Murray Cumming)
* Build fix. (Daniel Holbach)

1.1.5:

* List view: When remembering column widths, allow the columns to be
  resized smaller again. Bug #358089 from Peter Williams.
* Related Records:
  - Avoid a SQL error when showing a doubly-related field without showing
  the key field that is used in the relationship.
  - Allow the developer to specify to what table the user will be taken
  when clicking on the row button, or just use the automatic choice.
* Button scripts: Update the view after the script has run, in case it
  changed any data.

1.1.4:

* List view: Remember column widths when you resize them manually.
  Bug #358089 from Peter Williams.
* Find: Fix crash when searching on more than one field (an AND).
* Fixed some memory management problems.
  (Murray Cumming)

1.1.3:

* Added Add Related Table item to the Tables menu. This is a time-saving
  feature to quickly create a related table and a relationship to it,
  and is a first step to implementing further refactoring functionality.
  Bug #355975.
* Creating from examples: Correct a problem that could lead to Glom not
  using all the rows of example data.

1.1.2:

* Related records:
  - When clicking the open button, show a warning dialog when the related
  record indicates a non-existant doubly-related record, making navigation
  impossible.
  - Allow navigation to doubly-related records (such as products from
  invoice lines on an invoice record), even when only the ID key is shown.

1.1.1:

* Field Formatting: You can now specify a number of text lines to show for
  multi-line text.
  Bug #355907 from Peter Williams.
* Layout editor dialogs: Added explanatory tooltips to the Add buttons.
* List views and related records portals:
  When no fields are specified, show a hint about editing the layout.
  Bug #354073 from Peter Williams.
* Avoid changing example files when using them to create new files.
* Field calculation editor: Prevent translators from translating the
  fragment of python code.

1.0.5:

* Connection dialog: Use mnemonics for accessibility navigation.
  Bug #349357 from Ryan Paul.
* Details view: Date fields: Really save the new value when selecting dates from
  the calendar. Bug #349359. (Johannes Schmid).
* Design Tables: Allow table names to contain special characters such as -.
  (You will need a newer libgda to allow database names to contain these characters too.)
* Loading from examples: Handle quoted commas in the example data and reject badly
  formatted example data.
* Build:
  - Added disable-update-mime-database configure option is apparently helpful
  for distro packagers. Bug #351989. (Fryderyk Dziarmagowski)
  - Fixed warnings with gcc 4. Bug #344815. (Elijah Newren)
* Avoid some crashes when dealing with unusual situations. (Murray Cumming)
* Examples: New examples added:

* Documentation: Added section about calculated fields. (Murray Cumming)
* Translations:
  - New Norwegian bokmål translation (Kjartan Maraas)
  - New Hungarian translation (Gabor Kelemen)
  - Updated Vietnamese translation (Clytie Siddall)

1.0.4:

* Related Records: When clicking the details buttons, just show the details, instead
  of flicking between details, list, and then details. That was annoying.
* List View:
  - When clicking Add, put the cursor in the appropriate column.
* Check for uniqueness before setting a value for a unique or primary-key field in the
  database.
* Calculations:
  - Allow the calculations to detect empty non-text fields, via the None object.
  - Recalculate calculations when a relationship's from key is changed, if that
  relationship is used in the calculation.
* In the Edit Tables dialog and Field Defintions dialog, do not double-click to open/edit,
  because this leads to awkwardsness/surprise because single click edits the cells too.
* Layout: Slight performance and positioning improvements.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Some more Windows/Cygwin build fixes. (Yselkowitz)
* Slightly (very slightly) more tango-like application icon. (Murray Cumming)

1.0.3:

* Fields: Prevent crash when adding field in non-English locale.
* Find:
  - Fix the [Find] button next to ID fields. It was wrongly saying that there
  were no results.
  - Really offer a second find when no results are found.
  - Show the busy cursor while finding.
* Layout: Really save changes of related records portal layouts and of custom
  field formatting.
* Some Windows/Cygwin build fixes.

1.0.2:

* Added a "..." (better suggestions welcome) next to date fields, to
  show a calendar dialog. New features like this should not be in the stable
  series, but this could help to solve a strange locale bug that someone is
  experiencing.

1.0.1:

* Correct failure while creating an example for the first time.
  (though it worked when you tried again.)
* Updated translations:
  - Finnish (Ilkka Tuohela)
  - Vietnamese (Clytie Siddall)
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)

1.0:

* List view: You can now click on the column headings to sort by a field.
* The busy cursor is shown during most communication or disk activity.
* Reports: The table title is now optional.

0.9.92

* Database Preferences: Added Organisation Logo field.
* Details layouts and report:
  * Added Image layout part, for arbitrary images on the layout.
* Reports:
  * Added Header and Footer parts.
  * Show images.
  * Tell the user that the report will be opened in the browser, in case the
    browser is not at the front.

0.9.91

* Creating databases: Make sure that the user is in the developer group, even if he has never
  opened an example, allowing him to change his own database.
* Date fields:
 - Show and parse 4 digits for the year, even if the locale (stftime) stupidly thinks otherwise,
   though this need attention from translators in affected locales. Fixed for en_GB (Britain).
   Was not a problem for en_US or de_DE.
* Details layouts:
 - Fields with choices are no longer insensitive when read-only, so you can now,
   for instance, select and copy text out of them, or see what is in their menus.

0.9.9:

* Details layouts:
  - Added a Notebook layout part, with tabs, so the details can show more information,
    such as several related layouts portals.
  - Stop pictures and calculated values from existing records appearing on new empty records.
* View Layouts and Reports:
  - Allow doubly-related fields. For instance, Actor::Agent::name on the Details of a
    a Character record.
  - Add a Text layout part, for arbitrary text on the Details view, or reports.
* Reports:
  - Allow top-level fields in reports, for non-grouped-by reports.
  - Allow use of Group By parts without specified group-by fields, so they
    can be (mis)used just to specify a sort field for non-grouped-by records.
  - Allow Group By parts to be sorted by multiple fields, and allow the sort
    order (ascending or descending) to be specified.
  - Added Vertical Group report part, for packing more information into a row.
  - Allow adding of fields as siblings while selecting the field, instead of
    requiring the user to select the parent group.
  - Allow custom formatting of fields.
  - Allow a border width to be specified for the records table cells.
  - Added a horizontal line below group-by titles.

0.9.8:

* Lookups: Fix intermittent problem that caused looked-up values to
  not be stored in the database.
* Related Records: Correctly reload portal layouts that use related
  (from the related table) fields, rather than just fields in the related table.
* Performance: Avoid querying for some unnecessary fields on Details view.

0.9.7:

* When creating from a read-only example, really do not mark the saved file
  as not an example, and save the new database name, so you can open it
  again from the saved file.
* Prevent duplicate table, field, relationship, and report names,
  to prevent crashes.
* Field Definition:
  - Default Value tab renamed to Value.
  - Default Values and lookups are now grouped as
    User Entry and are mutually exclusive with Calculation.
  - When changing a calculation, all values will be recalculated,
    with a warning and the chance to cancel.
  - Fix crash when changing field type to number, when not all
    existing values are valid numbers.
  - Fix crashes when converting from text to boolean.
  - Fix crashes when converting from boolean to number.
  - Preserve information when converting from anything to boolean.
* Details and List Views: Do not allow editing of calculated fields.
* Details View: Use the correct formatting for second columns in combo boxes for
  related choices.
* List View: Do not add a record when clicking on the Edit button on the last row
  - just go to the Details view.
* List layout: Warn that image fields are not supported on the
  list view yet.
* Date and Time Parsing improvements.
* New Translations:
  - Finnish (Ilkka Tuohela)
* Updated Translations:
  - Catalan (Josep Puigdemont)
  - Vietnamese (Clytie Siddall)

0.9.6:

* New built-in System Properties relationship:
  allows you to show fields from the system properties, such as
  the organisation's name and address, on a layout or report.
* The Field Layout Properties dialog (right-click on a field in
  developer mode to see the menu) now allows you to choose a custom title
  for the field for this instance, in case the regular field title is not
  appropriate. This is often the case for related fields.
* Save Field Layout Properties when the dialog closes. (Fixes a regression)
* Find:
  - Fix oddness in Details view when finding. (Fixes a regression)
  - Start Find mode on the current View, instead of always going to the Details view.
  - Find works again when you start on the Details view. (Fixes a regression)
  - Do a Find All if the find is not successful, if the user doesn't want to try again.
* Avoid python warnings when adding new records.
* Stop images from disappearing when refreshing layouts.

0.9.5:

* Details Layout:
  - Add Button layout item, to run arbitrary Python code, with access to
    the record data.

* Translations:
  Updated: Candadian English (Adam Weinberger),
  German (Hendrik Brandt), Czech (Miloslav Trmac)

* Translations: Added Kinyarwanda translation. (Steve Murphy)

0.8.19:

* List and Details: When defining the layout, developers
  can specify numeric formatting, such as decimal places,
  and currency symbols.

0.8.15:

* Related Fields:
  Details and List views can now show fields from related records.

* Details and List: Automatically-generated primary keys do not
  need to be displayed.
* List: Avoid GTK+ warning when clicking on empty space in the
  TreeView.
* Example:
  - Make some fields lookup their data from relationships:
    Invoice Lines gets product information from the products table,
    and Invoices looksup the customer name from the contacts table.
  - Warn if people recreate a database on the server from a
    read-only example file, because they will probably want to
    change things.

0.8.12:

* Postgres connection:
  - Really use the template1 database when creating new databases.
  - Slightly better error handling.
* Obscure internals:
  - Use a custom GdaValue-based treemodel for the List view,

  - Fix loss of layout groups when loading.
  - Allow adding of related records (half-finished) in the
    middle of the layout, and no longer show them automatically
    in a notebook.
    (It's really time to make this feel like glade.)
* Navigation:
  - Show table titles instead of name when in Operator mode.
* Build:
  - Distribute the intltool files.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162932 (Cezar)

  bit strange in yelp at the moment.
* Relationships:
  - Avoid crash when fields of differerent types are used in
  relationships.
