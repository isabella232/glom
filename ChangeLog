2011-08-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Don't move fields to 0,0 when choosing the field.

	* glom/mode_design/layout/dialog_choose_field.cc: get_field():
	Preserve the extra details of the start field, such as formatting 
	and print layout position.

2011-08-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Actually allow the user to change the text formatting.

	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/box_formatting.cc:
	When used for a print layout, enable the hidden checkboxes, because 
	other code checks for them.
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.cc: on_context_menu_formatting():
	Make the dialog transient for the parent window.
	Also, do not show numeric formatting for text items.

2011-08-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Correct drag positions when scrolled.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	Correct the rule position indicators, the rule drag positions, and 
	item drag positions, when the viewport is scrolled.
	canvas_convert_from_drag_pixels(): Add a bool adjust_for_scrolling 
	option, because the motion-notify-event signal already takes the 
	scroll offset into account, but the drag-motion signal does not.
	That does not seem to be documented.

2011-08-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Make items transparent.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_resizable.cc:
	create_rect_manipulators(): Make items transparent instead of white.

2011-08-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Allow rules to be moved.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_line_movable.[h|cc]: Added 
	set_hover_color() and make sure that color is used when the mouse is 
	over the line.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_grid.[h|cc]:
	Use CanvasLineMovable instead of PolyLine for rules, so it can 
	be moved. Make it appear red when hovering over it. Store the 
	lines instead of just the positions, so we can get the latest positions 
	later. This is rather inefficient, but it works.

2011-08-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Save the rules and the various show/hides.

	* glom/glom_document.dtd: Add the new nodes and attributes.
	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc: load_after(), save_before():
	Load and save these in the document.
	
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.cc:
	set_print_layout(): Set the menu actions from the PrintLayout
	so, for instance, the grid is shown if it was shown last time.
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.cc:
	set_print_layout(): Load and save the rules too.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_grid.[h|cc]:
	Added remove_rules() and get_horizontal/vertical_rules().
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_editable.[h|cc]:
	Added remove_rules() and get_horizontal/vertical_rules(), 
	calling the same methods in the grid.
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/print_layout.[h|cc]: 
	Added get/set_grid/rules/outlines() and 
	get_horizontal/vertical_rules().

2011-08-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Allow dragging of rules from the rulers.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_grid.[h|cc]:
	Added show_temp_rule().
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_editable.[h|cc]:
	Added show_temp_rule(), calling the one in the grid.
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	Constructor: Add a special target to the canvas (drag destination).
	Handle button-press on the rulers to identify the orientation.
	on_canvas_drag_motion(): Handle the new target, showing the temporary 
	rule line.
	on_canvas_drag_data_received(): Handle the new target, adding a real 
	rule line.
	on_canvas_drag_leave(): clean up.

	The rule lines are not saved to the document yet.

2011-08-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Actually show rules, if there are some.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_grid.[h|cc]:
	create_lines(): Split this into two methods, and make sure that 
	the z order is correct, so that we can really show the grid and 
	rules independently, without needing to recreate both at the 
	same time.
	Added set_rules_visiblity() to do so.
	add_horizontal_rule(), add_vertical_rule(): Actually create 
	the rules.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_editable.[h|cc]:
	Added set_rules_visibility() which just calls the same method 
	in the grid.
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.cc:
	on_action_menu_view_showrules(): Call it.

	Of course, there is no way to add a rule yet.

2011-08-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Make the window bigger by default.

2011-08-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Make ruler markers follow moved items.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.cc:
	on_selected_item_moved(): Show the top-left position of the group of 
	items, though maybe we should show just the moved item instead.
	Inkscape does not do this at all (it just shows the cursor position),
	so some other example would be nice.

2011-08-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Make ruler markers follow the cursor.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	Handle motion-notify-event so the rules track the cursor position.
	This is not very useful, but it feels nice, and is what other apps do.

2011-08-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Application: Remove unused member variable.

	* glom/application.[h|cc]: Remove m_pBoxSidebar.

2011-08-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Update the GimpRuler source copy.

	* glom/utility_widgets/gimpruler/gimpruler.[h|cc]:
	Updated from gimp's repository, from the gtk3-port branch.

2011-08-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Relationships Overview: Make snap to grid work.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_editable.[h|cc]:
	Add associate_with_grid().
	* glom/mode_design/relationships_overview/dialog_relationships_over
	view.cc: draw_tables(): Use it so that the items' snap_position() 
	methods have a grid to snap to.
	The whole grid association/add idea is generally hacky, but this makes it 
	work.

2011-08-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Deselect all items when clicking on the background.

	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.[h|cc]: 
	set_page_setup(): Handle button-press-event signals on the background,
	deselecting any selected items.
	create_margin_line(): Do the same if the user manages to click on a 
	line instead.

2011-08-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Relationships Overview: Correct the packing in the dialog.

	* ui/developer/dialog_relationships_overview.glade:
	Let the scrolledwindow expand. This was really silly and must have 
	happened during some edit with a bad version of Glade.

2011-08-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Select All: Added ctrl-A keyboard shortcut.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.cc:
	init_menus(): Because it is not part of the stock item, for some reason.

2011-08-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Add Select All and Unselect All menu items.

	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.[h|cc]: Added select_all(bool)
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	init_menus(): Edit menu: Add Select All and Unselect All menu items,
	which call that method.

2011-08-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Add a Show Outlines menu item

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]
	View menu: Add Show Outlines, with a handler, to show the extents of 
	the items.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_resizable.[h|cc]:
	Added a new group with lines, in a thinner fainter gray, to indicate 
	the outline. Added set_outline_visible() to show it.
	Move it whenever the child item moves, like the manipulator lines.
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.[h|cc]:
	Added set_outlines_visibility() to call this on all items.
	Store the value as a bool so we can use it again in 
	add_canvas_layout_item().

2011-08-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Allow moving of multiple items via x and y numbers.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	on_canvas_selection_changed(): Move the calculation of the group
	dimensions into get_dimensions_of_multiple_selected_items().
	on_spinbutton_x(), on_spinbutton_y(): Use the new method to get the 
	old dimensions, so we can calculate the offset and then apply it to 
	all items, moving them together.

2011-08-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Snap to grid when dragging items from the toolbar.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_resizable.h:
	snap_position(): Make this public.
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.cc:
	on_canvas_drag_motion(), on_canvas_drag_data_received():
	Snap the position to the grid (or rules), like we do when dragging 
	an existing item.

2011-08-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Improve the grid appearance.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.cc:
	on_menu_view_show_grid(): Use a smaller grid gap, which seems more useful.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_grid.cc:
	create_rule_line(): Make the lines thinner and light blue instead of 
	gray.

2011-08-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	CanvasGroupGrid: Simplify rule creation.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_grid.[h|cc]:
	create_grid_or_rule_line(): Rename to create_rule_line(), removing 
	the bool, because that is what it is used for.

2011-08-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Canvas_PrintLayout: Move all selected items when dragging.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_item_movable.[h|cc]:
	signal_moved(): Send the item (for convenience, to avoid dodgy use of
	sigc::bind() with RefPtr<>s) and the offset of just the current part 
	of the move.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_resizable.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_design/relationships_overview/dialog_relationships_over
	view.[h|cc]: Adapt.
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	on_selected_item_moved(): Move all the other selected items by the 
	same amount.

2011-08-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Canvas_PrintLayout: Selecting unselects others. Allow shift-clicking.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_item_movable.[h|cc]:
	signal_selected(): Also send the item (this), to avoid the need for 
	awkward (due to keeping a reference) sigc::bind()ing of RefPtr<>s.
	Send a bool group_select parameter too, so we know if the button 
	press (corresponding to the button release) was with the shift key 
	held down.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_editable.[h|cc]:
	on_item_selected(): Deselect other already-selected items if 
	the select was not with shift held down.

2011-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	CanvasItemMovable: set_selected(): Do not emit the signal here.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_item_movable.cc:
	set_selected(): Do not emit signal_selected here, because it should 
	only be emitted when the user causes it.
	on_button_release_event(), on_motion_notify_event():
	Emit the signal if necessary.

2011-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Canvas_PrintLayout: Edit menu: Support multiple items.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	on_canvas_selection_changed(): Store all the seleced items in a 
	vector instead of just one.
	on_menu_edit_copy(): Clone all the selected items in a vector, 
	instead of just one.
	on_menu_edit_paste(): Paste all the items, instead of just one.
	on_menu_edit_delete(): Delete all the items, instead of just one.
	on_spinbutton_*(): Adapt. These still assume that the SpinButtons 
	are only editable when only one item is selected.

2011-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Canvas_PrintLayout: Update position numbers when moving items.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	on_canvas_selection_changed(): Connect to the item's signal_moved,
	so we can update the spinbuttons during the move.
	on_spinbutton_*(): Ignore the spinbutton signals while we are setting
	them programatically, to avoid an endless loop.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_item_movable.cc:
	set_selected(): Emit the signal here if it has changed, rather than 
	always doing it after the call.
	on_motion_notify_event(): Mark the item as selected whenever it is 
	moved, therefore emitting the signal.

2011-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Canvas_PrintLayout: Fix typo to pass the item by reference.

	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.[h|cc]:
	add_canvas_layout_item(): Add a missing & to the parameter.

2011-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Implement cut/copy/paste/delete.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	Implement the edit menu, enabling/disabling the menu items based on 
	whether something has been selected or previously copied.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_editable.[h|cc]: Added 
	get_selected_items() here, making it virtual. The override in 
	Canvas_PrintLayout is the only real implementation so far.
	Added remove_item().
	remove_all_items(): Emit signal_selection_changed if something 
	was selected.
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.[h|cc]:
	Added remove_canvas_layout_item().
	Removed update_layout_position_from_canvas(), putting it in 
	Canvas_LayoutItem instead.
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_layout_item.[h|cc]:
	Added update_layout_position_from_canvas().

2011-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	CanvasPrintLayout: Remove unused method overload.

	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.[h|cc]: get_selected_items():
	The const overload is not used so remove it.

2011-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Cache the selected item.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	Store the selected item, when it changes, instead of repeatedly 
	requesting it, which requires iteration.

2011-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Allow editing of positions and size numerically,

	* ui/developer/window_print_layout_edit.glade: Add a row of SpinButtons
	at the bottom to show the position and dimensins of the selected item,
	also letting the user change them by changing the numbers.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_item_movable.[h|cc]:
	Added signal_selected().
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_editable.[h|cc]:
	Added signal_selection_changed().
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.[h|cc]: 
	Added get_selected_items().
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	Constructor: Get the SpinButton widgets from Gtk::Builder, and set their 
	values when an item is selected. Also change the item when the values in 
	the SpinButtons change.

2011-08-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Allow the user to select items with a click.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_item_movable.[h|cc]: 
	Added get/set_selected() and a virtual show_selected() which it calls.
	on_button_release_event(): set the item as 
	- selected if it unselected and the clicked without a move.
	- unselected if it was selected and clicked without a move.
	- selected if it was moved.
	This is roughly like Inkscape's behaviour.
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_resizable.[h|cc]:
	Split the manipulator group into two groups (edges and corners), 
	so we can (re)use the edges to show selection.
	Implement show_selected() to show/hide the edges.
	set_manipulator_visibility(): Make sure that we don't hide the 
	edges that are visible to show selection.

	This doesn't actuall do anything useful yet, but it will let us 
	do things to the selected item(s), such as editing their position via 
	coordinate numbers, moving them together, or copy/paste/cut/deleting 
	them via the menus.

2011-08-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Avoid warnings about -1 width.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_movable.cc: get_width_height(),
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_resizable.cc: get_width_heigh():
	Do not return -1, which groups default to, to mean some default size.
	This was not really used anyway, and was rejected when applied to non-group 
	goocanvas items.

2011-08-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Developer menu: Move the Developer item after Operator.

	* glom/application.cc: When the user changes this, he generally changes 
	from operator to developer, so this feels more natural.

2011-08-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout Window: default to 100% size

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.cc: init_menu():
	Default to 100% instead of fit-to-width, because this seems to give a 
	better idea that it is a page, by being more like applications such as 
	OpenOffice/LibreOffice write.

2011-08-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout Window: Make the top widgets more compact.

	* ui/developer/window_print_layout_edit.glade:
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	Make the table title/name a simple bold label with no Table: label,
	as now in the main window. Make the other labels non-bold.
	Make sure that we really show the table title with the name in brackets,
	by removing an unused (but checked) widget pointer.

2011-08-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layout: Correct drag position even when the layout is scrolled.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[h|cc]:
	Add and use canvas_convert_from_drag_pixels() to avoid the offset when 
	dragging an item from the toolpalette to the canvas when the canvas is 
	scrolled down.

2011-08-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Print Layouts: Make corner and edges snap to the grid too.

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_resizable.[h|cc]:
	Add a set_grid() override(), as in CanvasGroupMovable, so that the 
	manipulator items also know about it, even though the manipulators 
	were created earlier, in the constructor.

	Previously snapping to the grid only worked while moving whole items.

1.19.9:

2011-07-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Design: Related Records: Allow the developer to specify how many rows to show.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/layoutitem_portal.[h|cc]: Add 
	set/get_rows_count() to specify how many rows to show.
	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc: Load and save that rows count.
	* ui/developer/window_data_layout.glade: Add a SpinButton to specify the 
	number of rows to show in related records portals.
	* glom/mode_design/layout/dialog_layout_details.[h|cc]: Get that widget, 
	but hide it in this base class.
	* glom/mode_design/layout/dialog_layout_list_related.[h|cc]:
	Constructor: Show and setup the spinbutton.
	set_document(): Set the spinbuttons's contents.
	save_to_document(): Save it back to the portal layout item.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list_related.cc: create_layout():
	Use DbAddDel::set_height_rows() to try to show the correct number of rows.
	
2011-07-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Ignore warning about invalid GdaBinary GValue.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.[h|cc]: Add and use get_binary() method, 
	to avoid trying to get a GdaBinary from a null (type) Gnome::Gda::Value.

2011-07-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Add commented-out code to load PDFs from memory.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: This needs new API in bug #654832

2011-07-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Save temp files as read-only to avoid unexpected data loss.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: save_temp_file(): Set the file 
	permissions.

2011-07-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Avoid autoconf warning about datarootdir.

	* glom/libglom/glom.pc.in: Set datarootdir to avoid this warning:
	config.status: WARNING:  'glom/libglom/glom.pc.in' seems to ignore the --datarootdir setting
  as suggested here:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/autoconf/Changed-Directory-Variables.html

2011-07-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Do not try to get a thumbnail for non-image, non-evince types.
	
	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: Just use g_content_type_get_icon(),
	to avoid saving temporary files of huge content, such as video, when just 
	navigating through rows.

2011-07-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Remove unused member variable.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.[h|cc]: Also add a comment that 
	gnome_desktop_thumbnail_factory_new() didn't work either when I tried it.

1.19.8:

2011-07-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Set an appropriate default file filter.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: evince-view sets its own default, 
	but that's not ideal for us.

2011-07-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Use G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_ICON

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: If G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_THUMBNAIL_PATH 
	doesn't work, use the standard icon. This does seem to work. 

2011-07-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Try to use G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_THUMBNAIL_PATH for other file types.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.[h|cc]: show_image_data():
	Get the mime_types supported by GdkPixbuf and only try to use it if we have 
	a suitable mime type. Otherwise try to get a thumbnail from GFileInfo.
	That doesn't work now, probably because we should do that async.
 
2011-07-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Remove some unnecessary code.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: get_value(): Don't use the pixbuf just 
	to get the value.

2011-07-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Another scaling fix.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: get_scaled_image(): Don't return 
	an empty pixbuf just because the pixbuf doesn't not need to change.

2011-07-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Remove limits so we always scale, and use on_size_allocate().

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.[h|cc]: Use on_size_allocate() instead of 
	on_draw(), which is slightly wiser.
	Remove the hard-coded checks for minumum and maximum sizes, because 
	we get an initial allocation of 1, and because the max was arbitrarily small.
	* glom/utils_ui.cc: Fix this for images that are both 
	too wide and too high.
	
	This works now, but we still need to make the window get smaller when 
	the GtkImage requests less space.


2011-07-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Remove hard-coded mentions of PNG file formats.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: Open With: Use the actual (sniffed)
	mime type.
	Clipboard: Try to use the actual mime type, though this does not seem to 
	work for any mime type now.

2011-07-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Show the missing image icon again.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: set_value(): Clear the data, not the 
	pixbuf.
	show_image_data(): Check for empty data and show the missing icon if so.

2011-07-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Make the context-menu work with the EvView.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: Connect to the widget's own signal.

2011-07-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Loading/Saving: Add more FileChooser filters.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: set_file_filter_images():
	Use ev_document_factory_add_filters().

2011-07-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Image fields: Support PDF (and other types supported by evince)

	* configure.ac: Depend on evince-view-3.0, which is a library installed by 
	evince. It is packaged separately from evince by distros.
	* glom/main.cc: Call ev_init().
	* glom/utility_widgets/dialog_image_load_progress.[h|cc]: Remove 
	get_pixbuf() and do not use Gdk::PixbufLoader here.
	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.[h|cc]: Create the pixbuf here, from 
	the data from the dialog.
	Add an EvView, and use that instead of the Gtk::Image when the mime type is 
	supported by EvView. We use g_content_type_guess() to sniff the mime type 
	from the actual data, but this will probably not always work. We should 
	store the mime type (and the filename) too.
	
	The context menu doesn't work with the EvView yet.

1.19.7:

2011-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Saving is now mostly async.

	* glom/utility_widgets/dialog_image_save_progress.[h|cc]: Doing the actual 
	writing in callbacks, like in the loader.
	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: Show the dialog, so we can use the 
	idle callbacks, and give user feedback.

2011-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Allow the user to choose any file.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: However, we are still restricted to 
	what GdkPixbuf can load.

2011-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Do not transform to PNG output when saving.

	* glom/utility_widgets/dialog_image_save_progress.[h|cc]: Replace set_pixbuf() 
	with set_image_data().
	save(): Save the original data, instead of saving the data from the pixbuf.
	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: Adapt.
	This means, for instance, that if the user loads the a JPG in then they will 
	get exactly the same JPG out.

2011-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Some minor signed type corrections.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.cc:
	* glom/xsl_utils.cc: Gio::FileOutputStream::write() returns a gssize, not a 
	gsize.

2011-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Size request corrections.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: init(): Remove the set_size_request() 
	call which does not seem necessary.
	Do not call set_image(original) after scale(), because scale() does that, 
	setting the scaled image.
	This avoids the GtkImage being huge, because GtkImage re-requests the 
	bigger size again when the original is put in it.
	This is still not ideal. It would be nicer if we could just say "do not 
	make the window bigger than the screen, or do not make this make the 
	window bigger."

2011-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ImageGlom: Use AppInfo instead of gtk_show_uri() for Open.

	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc: For the case that we have no AppInfo
	(not Open With), use the static AppInfo method, for consistency.
	This might work on Win32 too.

2011-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Image fields: Add Open, Open With, and Save context menu items.

	* glom/utility_widgets/dialog_image_save_progress.[h|cc]:
	* ui/operator/dialog_image_save_progress.glade:
	Added a progress dialog to do image saving, though it does not yet do 
	async saving so the dialog is never shown.
	* Makefile.am:
	* Makefile_glom.am:
	* po/POTFILES.in: Mention the new files.
  * glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.[h|cc]: Add the new context menu items,
  using a temporary file for the Open and Open With features.
  Open With uses AppChooserDialog to offer a choice to the user.
  Bug #630057

2011-07-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Rename Dialog_Image_Progress to DialogImageLoadProgress

	* glom/utility_widgets/dialog_image_progress.[h|cc]:
	Rename to 
	* glom/utility_widgets/dialog_image_load_progress.[h|cc]:
	* tests/test_glade_derived_instantiation.cc:
	* ui/operator/dialog_image_progress.glade: Rename to
	* ui/operator/dialog_image_load_progress.glade:
	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.h:
	* Makefile.am:
	* Makefile_glom.am:
	* po/POTFILES.in: Adapt.
	
	I can then add a new dialog for saving.

2011-07-11  Ben Konrath  <ben@bagu.org>

	Add PACKAGE_TARNAME variable to pkg-config file.

	This is needed for the @docdir@ expansion used in the exampledir
	variable.

	* glom/libglom/glom.pc.in:

2011-07-11  Ben Konrath  <ben@bagu.org>

	Add exampledir variable to pkg-config file.

	* glom/libglom/glom.pc.in:
	Bug #654384

2011-07-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Add translator comments.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/field.cc:
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/*.c:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list.h:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_manyrecords.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/notebook_data.cc:
	* ui/developer/dialog_script_library.glade: Add translator comments.
	Bug #638996 (Joe Hansen)

2011-07-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Related Records: Show enough records.

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: Added set_height_rows(), so 
	we can set the minimum size based on the number of rows, though this 
	currently hard-codes a size for the non-rows part of the GtkTreeView, such 
	as the column headers.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_portal.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list_related.cc: Constructors: Remove unnecessary 
	calls to set_size_request().
	Call set_height_rows() instead.

  The related records Gtk::TreeViews probably became too small since the port to 
  gtkmm3. We now need to use Gtk::ScrolledArea::set_min_content_height().
  
  However, the number of rows should probably be something for the layout to 
  specify per portal.
	
2011-07-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Minor int->guint change.

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: get_fixed_cell_height(): 
	Return a guint instead of an int.

2011-07-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Do not navigate past the last row.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/treemodel_db.[h|cc]: get_last_row(): 
	Document that this never returns the placeholder row, and make sure that it 
	does not. There was a typo that --ed the wrong variable.
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: get_last_row(): 
	Document that this never returns the placeholder row.
	get_is_placeholder_row(): Remove an illogical call to is_last_row().
	get_count(): Remove an illogical check to see whether the last row is the 
	placeholder row.
	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel/adddel.h: get_last_row(): Document that this 
  similarly-APIed widget has different behaviour.
  
  This stops the user from being taken to an empty record when clicking Last, 
  or when clicking Next to the end.
  Bug #526115 comment #25 (Michael Hasselmann)

2011-07-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	DbAddDel: Remove unnecessary virtual keywords. 

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.h: These methods are not meant to 
	be overridden by anything.

1.19.6:

2011-07-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	About Box: Add a logo.

	* glom/application.cc: Use set_logo() though this only appears in the title 
	bar for some reason.

2011-07-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Really fix the About Box.

	* glom/application.cc: Add the Help menu itself, and use set_program_name() 
	instead of set_name().

2011-07-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Improve the About box.

	* glom/application.[h|cc]:
	* glom/bakery/app.[h|cc]:
	* glom/bakery/app_withdoc_gtk.[h|cc]: Move the help menu out of the 
	Bakery class, doing it all in our derived Application class, to give us 
	more control over the GtkAboutDialog. We do not need the abstraction any 
	more.
	This restores the application description, which was probably lost when 
	converting to AboutDialog.
	
2011-07-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Split up the developer .glade files into separate files.

	* ui/developer/:
	* glom/glade_utils.h: get_glade_widget_derived_with_warning(): Guess the 
	filename based on the requested ID, for developer UI as we already did 
	for operator UI.
  This makes it possible to edit these in recent versions of Glade, without 
  Glade silently renaming IDs to make them unique across the whole file.
  * po/POTFILES.in:
  * Makefile.am: Mention the new files.

2011-07-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Enable silent build rules by default.

	* configure.ac: This is still only used if the automake version is recent 
	enough.

2011-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ListView: Make the rows high enough.

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: get_fixed_cell_height():
	Add the GtkTreeView vertical-separator style property to the height, 
	which might be the right thing to do, and which works here at least.

2011-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Find: Make searching case-insensitive again.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.cc:
	get_string_find_operator(): Use ILIKE, though this requires the lastest 
	libgdamm from git master.
	Find has been case-sensitive since around glom 1.16, since we started 
	using SqlBuilder.

2011-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Backends: Slight reorganization.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/backend.h:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/sqlite.[h|cc]: Move method 
  implementations into the .cc files.

2011-06-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Field::sql_find(): Do not quote the string.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/field.cc: SqlBuilder already takes 
	care of quoting so this just changed the actual value.
	This makes Quick Find work again.

2011-06-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Find: Use backend-specific LIKE or ILIKE operator instead of =.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/backend.h:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.h:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/sqlite.h:
	get_string_find_operator(): Return the Gnome::Gda operator enum 
	instead of the operator as a string.
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/field.[h|cc]: sql_find_operator():
	Likewise, return the Gnome::Gda operator enum.
	* glom/libglom/utils.cc: get_find_where_clause_quick():
	* glom/mode_data/box_data.cc: get_find_where_clause():
	Use Field::sql_find_operator() and Field::sql_find(), as per 
	the TODO comments.

	This was code that I forgot to change properly when porting to 
	use Gnome::Gda::SqlBuilder, so this has been broken since 
	Glom 1.16.
	Find still does not work.

2011-06-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Frame: Rename a signal handler.

	* glom/frame_glom.[h|cc]: Rename on_menu_Mode_Toggle() to 
	on_menu_Edit_Find() because that is what it is now.
	* glom/application.cc: Adapted.

2011-06-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Main window: Moved the Records/Found widgets to the top-right.
	
	* ui/operator/window_main.glade: Remove the footer row of widgets.
	* glom/frame_glom.[h|cc]: Instead build them manually and add them (in a box) 
	to the notebook at the right-hand side next to the tabs.

2011-06-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Split the operator .glade files up into one file per top-level ID.

	* ui/operator/: Split the .glade files up, giving them the same names 
	as the top-level (or almost top-level) IDs that the code looks for.
	* glom/glade_utils.h: get_glade_widget_derived_with_warning(): Guess the 
	filename based on the requested ID.

2011-06-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Move .glade files into subdirectories under ui/

2011-06-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Move .glade files into a ui/ directory.

	* glom/glom.glade:
	* glom/glom_developer.glade: Moved to 
	* ui/
	This will be useful when they are split up more.

2011-06-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Main window: Show the table title in find mode too.

	* glom/frame_glom.[h|cc]: Use an extra label for the 
	find mode.

2011-06-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Do not hide table-specific menu items in Operator mode.

	* glom/application.cc: update_table_sensitive_ui().

2011-06-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Main Window: Combine the top two rows of widgets.

	* glom/utility_widgets/notebook_noframe.[h|cc]: Add 
	set_action_widget(), as in the GtkNotebook API.
	* glom/glom.glade:
	* glom/frame_glom.[h|cc]: Remove the top HBox, instead 
	putting the table name label in the notebook widget, 
	at the left of the tabs.

2011-06-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Remove the User Level menu and the User Level label.

	* glom/glom.glade: Main window: Remove the User Level label.
	* glom/application.[h|cc]:
	* glom/frame_glom.[h|cc]: Remove the User Level menu, moving 
	its two radio menu items to the top of the Developer menu.
	init_menus(), update_table_sensitive_ui(): Make sure that all
	developer items are deactivated in operator mode, now that 
	we don't just deactivate the whole developer menu.

2011-06-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Main window: Simplify widgets at top.

	* glom/glom.glade:
	* glom/frame_glom.[h|cc]: Remove the Table: label. Make the 
	table name normal sized, but still bold. Remove the mode 
	labels, because there are only two modes now, and it should 
	be obvious when you are in the middle of entering find criteria.

2011-06-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	glom.glade: Resave with glade.

	* glom/glom.glade: Resave with glade 3.10, which changes 
	object IDs to be unique across the whole file.
	Chose human-readable IDs instead of number suffixes.
	* glom/navigation/box_tables.cc:
	* glom/frame_glom.cc: Adapted the code.
	This is rather tedious and just makes code less readable.

2011-06-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	glom.glade: Reorder top-levels alphabetically.

	* glom/glom.glade: Glade now does this when saving,
	so this will make it easier to see what else Glade 
	has changed.

1.19.5:

2011-06-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Require the latest libgdamm, for the GdaNull changes.

	* configure.ac: Require libgdamm 4.99.3

2011-06-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Fix the tests after the libgdamm Null Value change.
  
	* tests/python/test_python_execute_script.cc:
  Do not try to instantiate a static Value instance because the constructor 
  now needs the GType system to be initialized.

2011-06-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Make Primary Key ID values visible again.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/entry.cc: Use unset_color() instead of 
	override_color(RGBA());

2011-06-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build with --enable-warnings=fatal with gtkmm 3.1.

	* glom/mode_data/box_data_details.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel_withbuttons.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_formatting.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel/adddel_withbuttons.[h|cc]:
	Fix the build with --enable-warnings=fatal with gtkmm 3.1, by
	replacing Gtk::HButtonBox with ButtonBox and replacing get_vbox() with
	get_content_area().

2011-05-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix compiler warnings.

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/dialog_layout_details.cc:
	* glom/report_builder.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtable/eggspreadtablednd.c
	(get_index_at_position):
	* tests/test_parsing_time.cc: Remove unused variables noticed by g++ 4.6.

2011-05-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Require latest libepc.

	Because it uses avahi-ui-gtk3, which uses GTK+3.
	Otherwise we would be indirectl using both GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3.

2011-04-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Egg::SpreadTable: Add a test.

	* Makefile_tests.am:
	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtablemm/test_preadtablemm.[h|cc]:
	Add a test based on the C test. It seems to work fine.

2011-04-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Egg::SpreadTable: Derive from (and implement) Orientable.

	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtablemm/eggspreadtablemm.[h|cc]:
	Use Orientable.

2011-04-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the make check build.

	* Makefile_glom.am: Create a variable for the eggspreadtable file list.
	* Makefile_tests.am: Use that variable here, so we link against the new
	files.

2011-04-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	EggSpreadTableDnd: Wrap the wiget_drop_possible signal.

	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtablemm/eggspreadtabledndmm.[h|cc]:
	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtablemm/private/eggspreadtabledndmm
	_p.h: This is unpleasant without gmmproc.

2011-04-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Egg::SpreadTableDnd: Fix typos.

    * glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtablemm/eggspreadtabledndmm.cc:
    Use the correct GTypes.

2011-04-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use EggSpreadTableDnd.

	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtable/eggmarshalers.[h|c}
	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtable/eggplaceholder.[h|c]
	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtable/eggspreadtablednd.[h|c]:
  Added these files, copied from libegg.
	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtablemm/eggspreadtabledndmm.[h|cc]:
	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtablemm/private/eggspreadtabledndmm
	_p.h:
	Created a hand-written C++ wrapper for EggSpreadTableDnd.
	* glom/Makefile_glom.am: Mention the new files.
	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.h: Use SpreadTableDnd instead of
	SpreadTable, though we do not use the drag-and-drop functionality yet.

2011-04-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Correct the sizing of the ... date button.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/datawidget.cc: There is a button next to
	all date fields, for selecting the date. Make sure that it does not expand.
	Of course, a real date selection widget would be nicer.

2011-04-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Update the EggSpreadTable code.

	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtable/eggspreadtable.[h|cc]: Update this
	code from libegg/libegg/spreadtable/

2011-04-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix distcheck.

	* Makefile.am: Distribute the .db file for the sqlite example.
	This fixes the discheck, because we use it in a test.
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/sqlite.cc: connect(): Give clues
	on stderr if the file is missing.
	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]: Add a file_exists(Gio::File) override for use
	by those checks.

1.19.4:

2011-04-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix a test.

	* tests/python/test_python_execute_func_bad_syntax.cc:
	Allow the result to be a null Gda::Value, because that is acceptable for a
	python script with invalid syntax.

2011-04-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Port the debian repository analyzer script example to GTK+ 3.

	* examples/example_scripts/repository_analyzer_begin_scan.py:
	Use PyGObject+Introspection instead of pygtk, and adapt for a minidom API
	change.
	This is also here:
	https://gitorious.org/debian_repository_analyzer

2011-04-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix use of bool python return types.

	* glom/libglom/python_embed/pygdavalue_conversions.cc:
	glom_pygda_value_from_pyobject(): Use the C Py*_Check() functions because
	boost::python::extract<>::check() does not really check for the exact type
	and has no way to do that. Previously we were interpreting bools as ints.
	Note also that the order fo the Py*_Check() checks is important, because
	python considers bool to be derived from int.
	* tests/python/test_python_execute_func_with_record.cc: Uncomment the checks
	for the return type and value now that it works.

2011-04-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Initialize pygobject, to fix the use of the PyRecord API.

	* configure.ac: Require the latest pygobject with gi.repository support.
	* glom/libglom/init.cc: Include pygobject.h so we can call pygobject_init()
	here.
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_record.cc: Define NO_IMPORT_PYGOBJECT
	so we can still include pygobject.h again here. pygobject.h uses a nasty
	variable declared in the header.
	* tests/python/test_python_execute_func_with_record.cc: Fix the python
	example code.
	However, this shows a problem with getting bool results from python,
	apparently because boost::python::extract<>::check() checks that the type
	is compatible rather than checking that it's the exact type.

2011-04-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Added a python function test that uses an actual database connection.

  * Makefile_tests.am: Mention the new test.
	* tests/python/test_python_execute_func_with_record.cc: This shows
	a crash in Glom::PyGlomRecord::get_connection().

2011-04-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Moved the python tests to a sub-directory.

	* tests/test_load_python_library.cc:
	* tests/test_python_execute_func.cc:
	* tests/test_python_execute_func_bad_syntax.cc:
	* tests/test_python_execute_func_change_result_type.cc:
	* tests/test_python_execute_func_date.cc:
	* tests/test_python_execute_script.cc:
	* tests/test_python_module.cc: Moved to tests/python/
	* Makefile_tests.am: Adapted.

2011-04-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Remove more small traces of pygda.

	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_record.cc:
	* glom/python_embed/glom_python.cc:
	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc: Some last minor renames
	from pygda to gi.repository.Gda.

2011-04-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Python: Use gi.repository.Gda instead of Gda.

	* configure.ac: Do not require pygda at build time, though we check for it
	at program startup. There is probably no similar way to check at configure
	time, and it's debatable that it's appropriate anyway. The pygda check
	was probably here before in order to use a pygda .h file that we no longer
	use.
	* glom/main.cc: Add and call check_gir_is_available_with_warning() to check
	that gi.repository (gobject intropsection) in general is available.
	* glom/python_embed/glom_python.[h|cc]:
	* tests/test_python_module.[h|cc]: Add gir_python_module_is_available() for
	use by main.cc.
	gda_python_module_is_available(), glom_python_call(): Use the new python
	module instead of the old Gda module.

2011-04-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Write Python tracebacks to stderr.

	* glom/application.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/dialog_database_preferences.cc:
	* tests/test_python_execute_script.cc: Output python errors to stderr as a
	clue when things go wrong.

2011-04-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix an error found by the gtkmm change to use operator const void*.

	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel/adddel.cc: There is no
	TreeNodeChildren::operator[](TreeIter). The compiler was casting the TreeIter
	to bool and then to (int)0.

2011-04-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Require the latest mm-common and dist the mm-common scripts.

	* configure.ac: Add a MM_CONFIG_DOCTOOL_DIR() call so that the scripts will
	be distributed with the tarball, avoiding a runtime dependency on mm-common.

2011-03-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Adapt to the recent gtksourceviewmm API change.

	* configure.ac: Require the latest gtksourceviewmm.
	* glom/mode_design/dialog_database_preferences.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fieldcalculation.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fielddefinition.h:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_buttonscript.[h|cc]:
	:
	* glom/mode_design/script_library/dialog_script_library.[h|cc]: Use
	Gsv::* instead of Gsv::Source*.

2011-03-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Update the document DTD.

	* glom/glom_document.dtd: Mention some the new attribute and element
	for the choices, to fix the DTD test during make check.

2011-03-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	A simpler way to avoid the PyDateTime_Check() crash.

	* glom/libglom/init.cc: libglom_init(): Remove the g_assert because this
	can fail: See bug #644702.
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/pygdavalue_conversions.cc:
	glom_pygda_value_as_boost_pyobject(): Check that the local re-import
	(hopefully cached by Python) succeeded, to avoid a crash in PyDateTime_Check().

2011-03-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Reverted the previous commit to prevent a crash if PyDateTime_IMPORT fails.

	* glom/libglom/init.[h|cc]: Added libglom_pydatetime_import() and
	libglom_pydatetime_imported(). Remove the g_assert() when it fails.
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/pygdavalue_conversions.cc: Use the new
	utility function instead of repeating our reimplementation here.

	There will now just be an error message on stderr. We must fix this properly
	but in the meantime it is better than requiring the use of a separate glom
	branch just for OnlineGlom.
	See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=644702

	This commit was reverted because we really must repeat the implementation
	everywhere, because the PyDateTime variable is declared in Python's datetime.h
	header, and the macros then try to use that local instance. The copy in
	init.cc is not available to callers.
	And we cannot include datetime.h from init.h because it is full of other
	problems that cause compiler warnings.

2011-03-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Depend on libgdamm-5.0 instead of libgdamm-4.0.

	* configure.ac: This change avoids an indirect dependency on GTK+ 2,
	needed by the libgda 4 tarball build.

2011-03-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	libglom: Added utils::build_sql_select_count_rows().

	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]: Make count_rows_returned_by() take a const SqlBuilder.
	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]: Move some of count_rows_returned_by() into a
	build_sql_select_count_rows() method, for the convenience of UIs such as
	OnlineGlom.
	Bug #645110 (Ben Konrath)

2011-03-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Do not crash if PyDateTime_IMPORT fails.

	* glom/libglom/init.[h|cc]: Added libglom_pydatetime_import() and
	libglom_pydatetime_imported(). Remove the g_assert() when it fails.
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/pygdavalue_conversions.cc: Use the new
	utility function instead of repeating our reimplementation here.

	There will now just be an error message on stderr. We must fix this properly
	but in the meantime it is better than requiring the use of a separate glom
	branch just for OnlineGlom.
	See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=644702

2011-03-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Project Manager example: Resave.

	* examples/example_project_manager.glom: Edit the Teams list layout, so
	that it actually has a layout in the file, and so that the fields order
	makes more sense.
	See http://gitorious.org/online-glom/gwt-glom/commit/1c860b7ad64f55809ecf7e6b340272800d586d35

2011-03-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build.

	* glom/libglom/init.cc: Add an include so we can use std::cerr.

2011-03-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	libglom_init(): Show the python exception when PyDateTime_IMPORT fails.

	* glom/libglom/init.cc: The linker seems to behave differently when this
	code is run from inside a JVM in OnlineGlom. This gives us a clue.

2011-03-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix crashes when using choices with fixed lists.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.[h|cc]:
	create_model_non_db(): Instead of creating just a text-based treemodel,
	create a Value-based one with an extra text column at the end. That is what
	the related-records model has, though it uses a custom TreeModel.
	The text column is needed for GtkComboBox when it has has-entry=true:
	(See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631167 )
	Add get_fixed_model_text_column() so that other code knows which column that
	is.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/cellrenderer_dblist.cc: set_choices_fixed(),
	repack_cells_fixed():
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.cc:	set_choices_fixed():
	Adapt to use the special column instead of assuming that column 0 is a text
	column.
	Previously Glom::Combo::set_value() crashed because we tried to get a
	Value<Gnome::Gda::Value> where there was a Value<ustring>.

2011-03-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Remove some unnecessary padding/borders around the main window.

	* glom/box_withbuttons.cc: Remove the border, because it is not useful.
	It would be for the parent widget to decide that.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.[h|cc]: add_group(): Add a with_indent
	optional parameter.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_details.cc: create_layout(): Have no indent on
	top-level groups.

2011-03-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use a custom Notebook-like widget instead of Gtk::Notebook.

	* glom/utility_widgets/notebook_noframe.[h|cc]: A new class with an API that
	is as much like the Gtk::Notebook API as we need it to be.
	Unlike GtkNotebook, this has no frame around the "page" at the bottom.
	That was wasting space because the extra division was unnecessary when it
	fills almost the whole window anyway.
	* Makefile_glom.am: Mention the new files.
	* glom/mode_data/notebook_data.cc: Derive from the new class instead of
	Gtk::Notebook.

2011-02-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the CSV import test.

	* tests/import/test_parsing.cc: Correct the number of expected tokens.
	This was previously just the number that was (incorrectly) parsed before.

2011-02-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	CSV Import: Fix quoted-newline detection, so we don't drop rows.

	* glom/import_csv/csv_parser.[h|cc]: on_idle_parse(): Make in_quotes a
	member variable, initialized in clear(), so we remember it across calls to
	on_idle_parse(), instead of thinking that we are in quotes just because we
	are parsing arbitrary chunks of bytes that look that way individually.

	This fixes bug #637529 (Darmon Xavier), so all rows should be imported
	instead of dropping some in the middle.

2011-02-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc-x61>

	Dialog_Import_CSV_Progress: Try to really show progress.

	* glom/import_csv/dialog_import_csv_progress.cc: Try to call
	Main::events_pending() and iterate() to really show the text in the progress
	bar, though it does not seem to work.

2011-02-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Correct a (translatable) string.

	* glom/glom.glade: Correct an English string. A comma is not a full stop.

2011-02-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Avoid GTK+ warning when clicking on the list button.

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: on_cell_button_clicked():
	Delay the response to the click, to an idle handler, to avoid confusing
	GtkTreeView, which was showing a warning with GTK+ 3 about a NULL GtkAdjustment.

2011-02-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use the new Gtk::ComboBox CellArea API to align columns properly.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.cc: Get the CellAreaBox and use its
	more-useful pack() method instead of the standard one, so that the columns
	really align.

1.19.3:

2011-02-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Require the correct gtksourceviewmm version.

	* configure.ac: Use the gtksourceviewmm version with the API changes to use
	vector.

2011-01-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Adapt to libgdamm API changes.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool.cc:
	* glom/libglom/db_utils.cc: libgdamm now uses std::vector instead of
	*Handle, like gtkmm.

2011-01-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Adapt to the gtkmm 3 change to using vectors.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/cellrenderer_dblist.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/dialog_choose_field.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/print_layout_toolbar_button.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.h:
	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/layouttoolbarbutton.cc: Use std::vector instead of
	std::list.
	* glom/dialog_existing_or_new.cc: This one even used the intermediate type
	directly, showing how necessary this API change was.

2011-01-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Disable more deprecated API.

	* configure.ac: Add PANGO, PANGOMM, and CAIRO to the list.

2011-01-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Require the appropriate gtksourceviewmm version.

	* configure.ac: Use the latest gtksourceviewmm release. Older versions would
	not build with the newer versions of gtkmm 3, so this is a hint.

2011-01-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Require the appropriate goocanvasmm version.

	* configure.ac: Use the latest goocanvasmm release. The code has already
	been ported.

2011-01-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	get_current_locale(): Handle more complex setlocale(NULL) results.

	* glom/libglom/utils.cc: locale_simplify(): On Ubuntu Natty,
	setlocale() has started returning a more complex string. Parse it, or the
	older simpler syntax.

2011-01-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	tests: Link to all necessary libraries.

	* Makefile_libglom.am: Define libglom_all_libs to avoid duplication.
	* Makefile_glom.am: Use libglom_all_libs instead of repeating.
	* Makefile_tests.am: Use libglom_all_libs to explicitly link against the
	dependencies of libglom. This seems to have been automatic with the linker in
	previous versions of Ubuntu, but not with Ubuntu Natty.

2011-01-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use Gdk::Cursor via RefPtr.

	* glom/bakery/busy_cursor.[h|cc]:
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_item_movable.[h|cc]:
	gtkmm 3 now requires Gdk::Cursor to be used via RefPtr.

2011-01-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Replace a used of (removed from GTK+) gdk_spawn_*() API.

	* glom/application.cc: This partially fixes the build.

2010-12-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	More dealing with cppcheck errors.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/layoutitem.cc: operator=(): Check for
	src=this.
	* glom/base_db.cc:
	* glom/frame_glom.cc:
	* glom/frame_glom.h:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres_central.cc:
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/foundset.cc:

	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel/adddel.cc:
	* tests/import/test_parsing.cc:
	* tests/import/test_signals.cc: Removed unused methods and unused variables.

2010-12-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Remove unused methods.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/glomconversions.cc:
	* glom/libglom/document/bakery/document.cc:
	* glom/libglom/document/bakery/document.h:
	* glom/libglom/document/bakery/document_xml.cc:
	* glom/libglom/document/bakery/document_xml.h:
	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc:
	* glom/libglom/document/document.h:
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/test_canvas_editable.cc:
	Remove unused methods, found by cppcheck. Some other methods that cppcheck
	mentions seem to be virtual methods that are used.

2010-12-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Remove unnecessary checks before use of delete.

	* glom/application.cc:
	* glom/bakery/app_withdoc.cc:
	* glom/bakery/app_withdoc_gtk.cc:
	* glom/frame_glom.cc:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool.cc:
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/layoutitem.cc:
	* glom/libglom/sharedptr.h:
	* glom/libglom/test_avahi_publisher.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_portal.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/notebook_data.cc: C++ doesn't mind if we call delete on a
	null pointer. Found by cppcheck.

2010-12-15  Ben Konrath  <ben@bagu.org>

	Add Eclipse 3.6 / CDT 7.0 configuration files.

	* .cproject: New file generated by Eclipse.
	* .project: New file generated by Eclipse.

2010-12-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix make check when using --enable-glom-ui=no.

	* Makefile_tests.am: Correct the LDADD flags for the selfhosting tests, so
	that make check still works when using --enable-glom-ui=no.

2010-12-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Build: Reduce some duplication.

	* Makefile.am:
	* Makefile_glom.am:
	* Makefile_libglom.am:
	* Makefile_tests.am: Use AM_CPPFLAGS and AM_CFLAGS just to hold the
	(optional) warning flags, as we did previously.

2010-12-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Build: Avoid use of non-UI cflags/libs where not necessary.

	* Makefile.am: Do not use AM_CPPFLAGS, AM_CFLAGS or AM_CXXFLAGS.
	* Makefile_glom.am:
	* Makefile_libglom.am:
	* Makefile_tests.am: Instead use individual variables for each target,
	making sure that we use only the necessary flags.
	libglom may have been linking to some unnecessary UI libraries before.
	* glom/import_csv/csv_parser.h: Avoid unnecessary UI includes.
	* tests/import/test_parsing.cc:
	* tests/import/test_signals.cc: Avoid including gtkmm.h.

	As a side-effect, the build is now longer, because some files are now
	compiled again separately for the tests, presumably because they now need
	to be built with different compiler flags. But that is a better test.

2010-12-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Correct my previous commit.

	* configure.ac: Correct the no/yes test for --enable-glom-ui and add a comma
	so it actually works.
	* Makefile_tests.am: Restore the source file lists for the python tests.

2010-12-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Allow libglom to be built without building the Glom UI code too.

	* configure.ac: Added an --enable-glom-ui option, defaulting to yes.
	When using --enable-glom-ui=no then only libglom will be built. This is
	useful for deployment of libglom to servers where the UI dependencies are not
	wanted.
	We still use GLOM_LIBS and GLOM_FLAGS even in libglom, instead of using
	LIBGLOM_LIBS and LIBGLOM_CFLAGS anywhere, but this does reduce duplication
	of the flags in glom's UI build.
	* Makefile.am: Do not include Makefile_glom.am if the UI should not be built.
	* Makefile_glom.am: Move the bin_programs definition to here.
	* Makefile_libglom.am: Move the LTLIBRARIES definitions to here.
	* Makefile_tests.am: Attempt, unsuccessfully, to build and run UI-dependent
	tests only when the UI was built, when running make check.

2010-12-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Fix the build with latest gtkmm.

	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.cc:
	Use Widget::render_icon_pixbuf() instead of the old render_icon() method.

2010-12-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Partial port to recent gtkmm API changes from git master.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/datawidget.cc: signal_style_changed was removed
	though it might come back later.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/entry.cc: Use override_color() instead of
	modify_text().
	* glom/mode_data/placeholder-glom.cc: Use set_source_rgba() instead of
	set_source_color(). Use get_style_context() instead of get_style().

2010-12-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build with latest gtksourceviewmm from git master.

	* glom/main.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/dialog_database_preferences.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/dialog_database_preferences.h:
	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fieldcalculation.cc:

	c:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_buttonscript.h
	:
	* glom/mode_design/script_library/dialog_script_library.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/script_library/dialog_script_library.h:
	* tests/glade_toplevels_instantiation.cc:
	* tests/test_glade_derived_instantiation.cc: Change the gtksourceview
	namespace to Gsv.

2010-12-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build with latest gtkmm from git master.

	* glom/mode_design/dialog_add_related_table.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fielddefinition.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/script_library/dialog_script_library.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/users/dialog_choose_user.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/users/dialog_users_list.cc: Adapt to the ComoboBoxText
	append_text() -> append() change.

2010-11-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Replaced GtkRuler with GimpRuler because GtkRuler was removed from GTK 3.

	* glom/utility_widgets/gimpruler/: Added several source files from
	gimp, with small changes to make it build for us, to provide the GimpRuler
	widget.
	* COPYING: Switch to GPL version 3 (instead of 2), because the GIMP source
	code uses it.
	* Makefile_glom.am:
	* glom/glom_developer.glade:
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.[cc|cc]: Use
	GimpRuler instead of GtkRuler, creating and adding them in code instead of
	in the .glade file, to avoid Glade needing to know about that widget.

1.19.2:

2010-11-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the tests build during distcheck

	* Makefile_glom.am: Correct eggspreadtablemm.c to eggspreadtablemm.cc.
	* Makefile.am:
	* Makefile_tests.am: Distribute the albums.csv test file and put the
	path to its directory in a define.
	* tests/import/test_parsing.cc: Use the define here, instead of using
	get_current_directory, which is not enough when builddir!=srcdir.

2010-11-17  Javier Jardón  <jjardon@gnome.org>

	Use upstream gettext instead Glib one

	* configure.ac: Do not use AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT() because it is no longer
	maintained/recommended.
	This fixes bug #631367

2010-11-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Import tests: Uncomment some tests and make them test what we really want.

	* tests/import/test_parsing.cc: Check that we do _not_ require ending newlines
	and check that we do _not_ require quotes around items.

2010-11-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Import tests: Disable more tests that do not seem useful.

	* tests/import/test_parsing.cc: Comment out the non-comma separators test and
	the ignoring-space-between-quoted-text test, because they don't seem to
	correspond to any specification.

2010-11-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Import tests: Disable tests that check for incorrect or useless behaviour.

	* tests/import/test_parsing.cc: Comment out the test to ensure that we
	- Ignore rows with no ending newline.
	- Ignore field values that are not quoted.
	because we should not do that.
	Also add comments explaining the regular expressions.

2010-11-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Re-enable the import tests and partially deal with their race condition.

	* Makefile_tests.am: Re-enable the import tests.
	* glom/import_csv/csv_parser.[h|cc]: Add ensure_idle_handler_connection(),
	moving the idle signal handler connection there. Also call it from the
	beginning and end of on_file_read(), in case it has been disconnected
	too early.
	Use a priority less than PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE, so that IO is likely to
	happen more often than the idle callback.

2010-11-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Import tests: Slight code-style change.

	* tests/import/utils.[h|cc]: Remove the MainLoop typedef because it just
	obscures things.

2010-11-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	CSV Import: Actually preview and import the field values.

	* glom/import_csv/csv_parser.cc: advance_field(): Remove an excess continue,
	so that we actually add the character to the field's text. This error
	was probably introduced while removing the non-exceptions ifdefs.
	This fixed bug #625693 (maximiliano).

	We really must fix those import unit tests so that something like this does
	not happen again.

2010-11-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	List view: Make the retry option actually work afer entering invalid data.

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: on_treeview_cell_edited():
	If the user chooses to retry the edit, remember what he entered, and restart
	the editing (in an idle handler, to avoid confusing the treeview), with
	that text.
	This fixes bug #167818

2010-11-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Update EggSpreadTable from libegg.

	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtable/eggspreadtable.c: Copy from
	libegg/libegg/spreadtable/ again, to use Tristan's corrections for the
	forall() vfunc.

2010-11-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Call xmlCleanupParser() because libxml++ does not anywmore.

	* glom/main.cc: main(): Call xmlCleanupParser() to clean up libxml to help
	valgrind.

2010-11-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	FlowTableWithFields: Fix some widget expansion behaviour.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/label.cc: Call Gtk::Label::set_line_wrap() to
	prevent the label from sometimes making the window insanely wide by demainding
	too much width for itself.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc: add_field_at_position(): Tell
	the field's widget to expand, so it uses more space if the user expands the
	window, instead of just expanding the gap between columns.
	Note that the old non-EggSpreadTable code only expanded the right-most column,
	so exanding both is a real improvement.

2010-11-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	EggSpreadTable: forall(): Avoid use of invalid GList items.

	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtable/eggspreadtable.c
	(egg_spread_table_forall):
	Use (and later free) a copy of the list, because the callback could call
	egg_spread_table_remove() which would change the list, causing us to use a
	list->next that is no longer valid. This fixes a problem found by valgrind.
	I don't know why other Gtk containers don't need to do this, though their
	code seems to do the same thing.

2010-11-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Added test_flowtablewithfields.

	* Makefile_tests.am:
	* glom/mode_data/test_flowtablewithfields.cc: Added the beginnings of a test
	of FlowTableWithFields.

2010-11-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use EggSpreadTable instead of GtkSpreadTable (not added to GTK+).

	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtable/eggspreadtable.[h|cc]:
	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtable/testspreadtable.c
	* glom/utility_widgets/eggspreadtablemm/eggspreadtablemm.[h|cc]:

	h: New files.
	* glom/Makefile_glom.am
	* glom/Makefile_tests.am: Mention the new files.
	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.[h|cc]: Use Egg::SpreadTable instead of
	Gtk::SpreadTable.

2010-11-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Remove the gconfmm dependency, because we don't use it.

	* configure.ac: Do not check for gconfmm.
	* glom/bakery/app_withdoc.cc: Do not include gconfmm.h.

1.19.1:

2010-10-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build with latest gtkmm 2.91.2

	* glom/mode_design/script_library/dialog_script_library.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/users/dialog_users_list.cc: Use ComboBoxText::remove_all()
	instead of clear_items().

2010-10-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	libglom: Change the ABI to 1.20, to avoid clashing with 1.16.

	* configure.ac:
	* glom/libglom/init.h:
	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc:
	* tests/test_load_python_library.cc: Change it everywhere, also correcting
	the python library name, which should have _ instead of . That was broken
	recently.

2010-10-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	distcheck: Remove check for NEWS update.

	* configure.ac: AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(): Remove check-news because it is not
	clever enough and because it prevents checking that distcheck works.

2010-10-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices Combo: Fix a warning.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.cc: set_choices_fixed(),
	set_choices_related(): Do not try to re-pack the existing cell.

2010-10-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices Combo: Fix a segfault.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.cc: set_choices_fixed(),
	set_choices_related(): Handle the has-entry case better, not calling clear(),
	because that breaks GtkComboBox, which then tries to use a removed
	GtkCellRenderer.

2010-10-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Let the combo drop-down be wide enough.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.cc: Constructor: Use the new
  set_popup_fixed_width() method.

2010-10-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	Tests: Fix a typo to fix make check.

	* tests/test_load_python_library.cc: Fix a typo to properly load the
  correct library name.

2010-10-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build with the latest gtkmm.

  * Makefile_glom.am:
  * po/POTFILES.in:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.[h|cc]: Removed this.
  * glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.cc: Add a has_entry parameter to the
  constructor and handle that in set_choices_related().

2010-10-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Build fixes after recent commits.

	* glom/libglom/db_utils.cc:
	* glom/libglom/utils.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/cellrenderer_dblist.cc: Adde back some
  includes of iostream and fix a size type.

2010-10-11  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	character arrays.

2010-10-11  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	Use unsigned integers where appropriate

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.[cc|h]:

2010-10-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	FlowTable: More fixes for child HBox memory management.

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.cc: Added checks and corrections, though
  there is still an odd warning about a refcount.

2010-10-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	FlowTable: Fix child HBox memory management.

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.[h|cc]: insert(), remove_all(), remove(),
  destructor: Remember the implementation-only Gtk::HBox widgets and delete
  them when appropriate. A simple Gtk::manage() was not enough for this.

2010-10-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	FlowTable: Avoid some runtime warnings.

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.[h|cc]: Re-add remove().
  get_column_for_first_widget(): Fix the implementation when it deals with
  children of the hbox.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc: Destructor: Avoid use of
  remove(widget), because it is complicated.

2010-10-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	FlowTable: Implement insert_before().

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.[h|cc]: Re-added insert_before() which
  we will need for drag and drop support.

2010-10-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Use of GtkSpreadTable: Remove FlowTable:m_children.

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.[h|cc]: Remove m_children and remove the
  remove() override, simplifying things.

2010-10-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Use of GtkSpreadTable: Use specified alignement again.

	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.[h|cc]: FlowTableItem: Remove the
  m_expand_first_full and m_expand_second members, because we no longer need
  to remember that information.
  add(): Use set_halign() to specify fill/left depending on the expand
  choice.

2010-10-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Use of GtkSpreadTable: Align widgets again.

	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc: apply_size_groups_to_labels():
  Re-enable the code to align adjacent widgets.
	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.[h|cc]: get_column_for_first_widget():
  Bring this code back, this time using the new
  gtk_spread_table_get_child_line() function.

2010-10-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: FlowTable: Initial use of GtkSpreadTable instead of custom code.

  * glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.[h|cc]: Derive from GtkSpreadTable,
  removing API and implementation that is then provided by that base class.
	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable_dnd.[h|cc]: Remove FlowTable_DND (and its
  use for now. We will need to reimplement it somehow with GtkSpreadTable,
  hopefully in a simpler way.

  * glom/mode_data/box_data_details.cc
  * glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfieldse.[h|cc]:
  * glom/utility_widgets/test_flowtable.cc: Adapted.

2010-10-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices: Do not offer editing formatting features when choosign extra fields.

	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/box_formatting.[h|cc]:
  Rename the two set_formatting() methods to set_formatting_for_non_field(),
  without the show_choices option and set_formatting_for_field(). This avoids
  using the wrong one at the wrong time.
  set_is_for_print_layout(): Rename to set_is_for_non_editable() and change
  the implementation to make it more generic.
	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]: offer_field_formatting(): Rename one overload to
  offer_non_field_item_formatting() and add a show_editable_options parameter
  to the field one.
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_field_layout.[h|cc]:
  set_field(): Added a show_editable_options bool parameter. Hide the editable
  checkbox and tell Box_Formatting not to show editing options.

	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_fieldslist.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_formatting.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_group_by.cc:

	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fielddefinition.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/dialog_layout_details.cc:
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.cc: Adapted.

2010-10-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Avoid SQL errors about invalid ORDER BY fields.

	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list.cc: create_layout():
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list_related.cc: create_layout(): Don't call
  set_columns() before set_found_set(), to avoid SQL parsing errors due to
  using invalid fields for sort (ORDER BY) clauses.

2010-10-05  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	Avoid uninitialized variables in CanvasGroupGrid

	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_group_grid.cc: Initialize
	variables at declaration.

2010-10-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices Layout: Fields List: Slight improvement.

	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_fieldslist.[h|cc]:
	Append new fields to the end instead of the start.

2010-10-04  Jon Nordby  <jonn@openismus.com>

	Set programming language explicitly around --enable-warnings macros

	* configure.ac:

2010-10-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Combo Choices: Extra fields dialog: Fix the title.

	* glom/glom_developer.glade: dialog_fieldslist: Remove the title, which
	was the old title left over from when this was just for secondary sort fields.
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/box_formatting.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_group_by.cc:
	Set the title manually so it is appropriate to each use.

2010-10-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	CellRendererDbList: Show related choices.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.[h|cc]:
	Rename type_model_columns and co with a _fixed suffix, to avoid using them
	for the related case.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/cellrenderer_dblist.[h|cc]: on_editing_started():
	Pack extra cells for the related case too, separating the fixed and related
	cases into separate methods.

2010-10-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ComboEntry: Actually show the text value in the drop-down.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/treemodel_db_withextratext.cc:
	get_value_vfunc(): Use m_column_index_key instead of get_value_key() because
	that is not set, because we do not call set_value_key() for each row. I
	will try to remove that maybe-unused API.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.cc: set_choices_related():
	Set up a cell_data_func for the automaticaly-added cell when we
	repack it, because calling clear() (to unpack it) disconnects the
	model-view association for that cell.

2010-10-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	TreeModelDbWithExtraText: Fix the use of Glib::Value.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/treemodel_db.cc: Intialize m_column_index_key
	to -1 so we can really check that it is uninitialized.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/treemodel_db_withextratext.cc: get_value_vfunc():
	Initialize both value instances and always set the output value.

2010-10-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ComboEntry: Fix silly typo.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.cc: Remove left-over for() loop.

2010-10-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices: Fix the custom tree model.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/cellrenderer_dblist.cc: Use the virtual text
	column here too.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/treemodel_db_withextratext.cc: Call the
	ObjectBase constructor with a custom typename, as in the base class. This is
	necessary because ObjectBase is a virtual base class.

2010-10-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the previous commit.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/treemodel_db.cc: Constructor: Actually fill
	m_column_fields so there are some columns in the tree model.

2010-10-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices combos: Fix ComboBoxEntry by using a virtual text column.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/treemodel_db.[h|cc]: Simplify the create()
	methods, removing the one that takes TreeModelColumns.
	* Makefile_glom.am:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/treemodel_db_withextratext.[h|cc]: A derived
	model (actually always used, but it keeps the code separate) that has an
	extra virtual text model, because GtkComboBoxEntry requires a text column.
	( https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631167 )
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.cc:
	set_choices_related(): Use the new derived model instead.
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: Adapted.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.cc: set_choices_related():
	Use the virtual text column.

2010-10-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices combos: Reuse the list view implementation. Only works for Combo now.

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/treemodel_db.[h|cc]: Moved to:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/treemodel_db.[h|cc]: so we can use it for the
	choices combo widgets too.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoices.[h|cc]:
	set_choices_related(): Make this pure virtual.
	Remove set_choices_with_second().
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/cellcreation.[h|cc]: create_cell():
	Use set_choices_related() instead of getting all rows as a list and
	using set_choices_with_second().
	* glom/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.[h|cc]:
	Override set_choices_related() and cell_connect_cell_data_func().
	Remove the use_model() pure virtual method.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/cellrenderer_dblist.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo_as_radio_buttons.[h|cc]: Adapt,
	setting up the view in overrides of set_choices_fixed() and
	set_choices_related() instead of use_model(), and being value-based
	where possible instead of converting values to and from text.

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: Move create_model_db() to
	DbTreeModel::create_from_items() so we can use it for the combo choice
	widgets too.
	refresh_cell_choices_data_from_database_with_foreign_key():
	Use set_choices_related() instead of getting all rows as a list and
	using set_choices_with_second().

2010-10-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix (unlikely) possible null dereferences shown by cppcheck.

	* Several files: Check the output parameter when getting widgets from glade.
	When this fails there is already a stderr warning and we could not recover
	anyway, but this helps cppcheck or maybe other chekers to only tell us
	interesting things.

2010-10-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc-x61>

	DbUtils: Move fill_full_field_details() here from Base_DB.

	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]: Move fill_full_field_details() from here to:
	* glom/libglom/db_utils.[h|cc]: here, so it can be used more generally,
	and because it isn't actually used much now, so it's just making Base_DB
	look even more complicated than it is.
	* glom/report_builder.cc: Adapted.

2010-10-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Document: fill_layout_field_details(): Handle choices layouts too.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/fieldformatting.[h|cc]:
	set_choices_related(): Take non-const parameters.
	Added a non-const version of get_choices_related() so we can update the
	full field details later.
	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc: fill_layout_field_details():
	Also try to update the field details in the choices lists.

2010-09-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build with the latest gtkmm 3 API.

	* glom/application.cc:
	* glom/dialog_existing_or_new.cc:
	* glom/frame_glom.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/translation/window_translations.cc:
  Use FileFilter via RefPtr.
	* glom/bakery/app_withdoc_gtk.cc: Use RecentFilter via RefPtr.
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/placeholder-glom[h|cc]:
	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable[h|cc]:
	* glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.[h|cc]: Change use of get_size() to
  get_preferred_size() and change on_expose_event() to on_draw().

2010-09-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build.

	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc: Restore missing tag names mistakenly
  removed in a previous commit.

2010-09-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Const corrections in use of LayoutItem and LayoutItem_Field in vectors.

  This allows DbTreeModel to take a vector of const items.

2010-09-24  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	Improve use of defines

	* *.h: Be more consistent with include guards.
	* glom/dialog_existing_or_new.cc:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres_self.cc:
	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc: Convert defines to static const
	data.

2010-09-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	DbAddDel: Some code rearrangement.

	* glom/base_db_table_data_readonly.h:
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: Split the db treemodel creation
  up into a separate function, ready for reuse by choices combo widgets.

2010-09-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	DbAddDel: Replace add_columns() with set_columns(), simplifying the code.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/layoutgroup.[h|cc]: Added non-const
  version of get_items_recursive().
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: Remove add_columns() and
  set_columns_ready(), replacing them with set_columsn() which takes a list
  of layout items. Remove DbAddDelColumnInfo because we do not use its other
  member variables, replacing it with the simple list of layout items.
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/treemodel_db.[h|cc]: Improve debug out.
	* glom/mode_find/box_data_list_find.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list_related.[h|cc]: Adapted.

2010-09-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Move code into a create_cell() utility function.

  * glom/mode_data/db_adddel/cellrenderer*.[h|cc]: Move to
  * glom/mode_data/datawidget/.
  * glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]:
  construct_specified_columns_cellrenderer(): Move some code into:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/cellcreation.[h|cc]: Added create_cell().
  This is less efficient, because we repeat some dynamic casts, but it
  makes construct_specified_columns_cellrenderer() less awfully huge by
  separating the code that supports cell editing. And it makes the code
  available to ComboChoices widgets later.

2010-09-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build with latest unstable gtkmm 3.

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: Adapt to CellSizeRequest::get_size().

2010-09-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	ComboChoices: Renamed set_choices() to set_choices_fixed()

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoices.h: Rename set_choices() to
  set_choices_fixed() to make code clearer.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo_as_radio_buttons.[h|cc]
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.[h|cc]
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/datawidget.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: Adapted.

2010-09-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Split Base_DB_Table_Data into a read-only base class.

	* glom/Makefile_glom.am:
	* po/POTFILES.in:
	* glom/base_db_table_data_readonly.[h|cc]: Created this new class from
	parts of:
	* glom/base_db_table_data.[h|cc]: which now derives from it.
	This let us use it for classes that do not allow the user to change the data.
	For instance, choice combo boxes.

2010-09-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build with gtkmm 3 from git master.

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.cc: Use SizeRequest::get_size() instead
	Gtk::Widget::size_request(), removed in gtkmm 3.

2010-09-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Replace use of ALIGN_LEFT/RIGHT/TOP/BOTTOM with START/END.

	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc:
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_layout_item.cc: Use only the non-deprecated
	enum values.

2010-09-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	DbAddDel: Cleanup: Rename glom_db_treemodel.[h|cc] to treemodel_db.[h|cc].

	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/glom_db_treemodel.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/treemodel_db.[h|cc]: Also rename the class from
	DbTreeModel to TreeModelDb to match.

2010-09-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices combo widgets: Improve the API.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.[h|cc]:
	Make create_model() non virtual, instead adding a pure virtual use_model().
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/cellrenderer_dblist.[h|cc]: Change the
	create_model() overrides to use_model() overrides.

2010-09-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices combo widgets: Initial work to make the model generic.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.[h|cc]: Change
	m_refModel to a generic TreeModel, make it private ,and add a
	get_choices_model() accessor, as a step to optionally using a db-based
	treemodel like Db_AddDel.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/cellrenderer_dblist.cc: Adapted.

2010-09-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Moved the Db_AddDel code.

	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/*.[h|cc]: Moved this to
	* glom/mode_data/db_adddel/ because that is where it is used.

2010-09-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	DbUtils: Improve debug output.

	* glom/libglom/db_utils.cc: query_execute_select(): Try to get more
  information about a connection timeout error when it happens.

2010-09-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Tests: derived instantiation: Test an extra dialog.

	* glom/mode_design/layout/dialog_layout_calendar_related.h: Correct the
  name of the header guard, to avoid a clash.
	* tests/test_glade_derived_instantiation.cc: Enable the test for this
  dialog.

2010-09-10  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	Make pc.in file unversioned

	* configure.ac: Additionally specify source file for unversioned
	glom.pc.in.
	* glom/libglom/glom-1.16.pc.in: Move to unversioned
	glom/libglom/glom.pc.in, which will be moved to a versioned file by
	configure.

2010-09-10  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	Use GLOM_ABI_VERSION in Makefiles and configure.ac

	* Makefile.am:
	* Makefile_libglom.am:
	* configure.ac: Use GLOM_ABI_VERSION to reduce duplication.

2010-09-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use libosso instead of libossomm on Maemo

	* configure.ac:
	* glom/main.cc: Use libosso instead of libossomm, because we just use
	one function.

2010-09-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Dialog_Layout_Report: Fix a crash, making all tests pass.

	* glom/mode_design/report_layout/dialog_layout_report.[h|cc]:
  Disconnect a signal handler in the destructor to avoid a crash when the
  GtkNotebook signal handler is called later, though we should fix that in
  GtkNotebook.

2010-09-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices drop-downs: More improvement of the column alignment.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.cc: create_model():
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/cellrenderer_dblist.[h|cc]:
	on_editing_started(): Remove (with clear) the automatically-added
	CellRenderer and re-pack it, so we can specify expand=false.

2010-09-09  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	Initial dialog: Really try to load examples from each path.

	* glom/dialog_existing_or_new.[h|cc]: list_examples_at_path():
  Use synchronous IO rather than asynchronous, to solve bug #626417.
  This means that we really check the result of trying the first directory,
  so we can try the other location too.

2010-09-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	Choices drop-down: Remove hack to fix the list view choices.

	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/cellrenderer_dblist.cc: Constructor:
  Remove the hacky call to Glib::ObjectBase(0) because it stopped
  on_start_editing() from being called, stopping the extra columns from being
  shown.

2010-09-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Choices drop-downs: Improve the column alignment.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.cc: create_model():
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.cc: create_model():
  * glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel.cc: on_start_editing():
  Use expand=false with pack_start() with the first column, plus xalign=0,
  so we can actually align the columns, though it only really works if the
  previous columns have values all of a similar width.
  And this doesn't work with ComboEntry or the cell renderer because
  GtkComboBoxEntry and GtkCellRendererCombo do the pack_start() of the first
  column automatically - see the comments.

2010-09-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	List view: Support multiple extra fields in choices here too.

  * glom/utility_widgets/cellrendererlist/cellrendererlist.[h|cc]:
  Split this into:
	* glom/utility_widgets/cellrendererlist.[h|cc]: with no extra/second-column
  functionality. It is now just a convenience class for a string-based combo
  cell.
  And into this:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/cellrenderer_dblist.[h|cc]: deriving from
  ComboChoicesWithTreeModel, like the regular combo widgets. Remove non-DB
  API.
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: Adapted.

2010-09-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Combo widgets: Support multiple extra fields.

	* glom/libglom/utils.cc: get_choice_values(): Actually get extra values other
  than than the first one, by actually using the index instead of just 1.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.[h|cc]:
  Added a virtual create_model(), to create model columns dynamically. So far
  they are just text columns.
  set_choices_with_second(): Recreate the model here each time.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.[h|cc]: Override create_model() to
  also set up the view columns using the widgets' specific API.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoices.h: set_choices_related():
  Stop this from being virtual because we no longer override it.

2010-09-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Initial support for multiple show-also fields in related choices.

	* glom/glom_developer.glade: Formatting box: related choices:
  Replace the second-field combo with a label and an edit button, to
  open a layout dialog allowing multiple items (fields).
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/box_formatting.[h|cc]:
  Add the code for that.
	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fielddefinition.cc: Handle changes to
  the extra layout group in BoxFormatting.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/fieldformatting.[h|cc]:
  Added a get_has_related_choices() with a has_second& parameter.
  Added a get_choices_related_relationship() convenience method.
  set/get_choices_related(): Change the field_second string parameter to
  a full LayoutGroup, allowing multiple items (fields).
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/layoutgroup.[h|cc]:
  Added a get_items_recursive() convenience method.
  Adapt to the FieldFormatting change.
	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc:
  load_after_layout_item_formatting(), save_before_layout_item_formatting():
  For the related choices extra fields, save an entire layout group instead of
  just a field name, supporting the deprecated way for documents with the
  old file format version.
	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]: get_choice_values(): Do not take
  the first and second fields as parameters. Instead get the information from
  the layout item. Support multiple fields, via the new layout group.
  Added get_list_of_layout_items_for_display() to show a preview of the
  layout group (list of fields) in the label in BoxFormatting.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc: Adapt to the FieldFormatting change.
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_group_by.cc:
  update_labels(): Improve this code, using the new
  Utils::get_list_of_layout_items_for_display() method.
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: Adapt to these changes.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo_as_radio_buttons.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoices.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.[h|cc]:
  set_choices_related(): Don't take the extra fields as a parameter. Instead
  discover them from the layout item.
  set_choices_with_second(): Change the list_value's parameter type to support
  multiple second values.
  refresh_data_from_database_with_foreign_key(): Adapt the to the use of a
  layout group instead of second field name, though this currently only uses the first field.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/datawidget.cc: Adapt to the combo API changes.

	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_fieldslist.cc: Make
  some code slightly more robust. Not really a related change.

2010-09-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Dialog_Properties: Remove the unnecessary virtual keywords.

	* glom/utility_widgets/dialog_properties.h: Make methods non-virtual
  because nothing overrides them.

2010-09-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Dialog_FieldsList: Fix a crash.

	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_fieldslist.cc: get_fields():
  Do not overwrite the vector, fixing a crash.
  Looking at this code, I think we also ignore reordering of items, so we
  should fix that later.

2010-09-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Add a --stop-auto-server-shutdown command-line option for debugging.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool.[h|cc]: Added set_auto_server_shutdown().
  startup(): Only handle the linux crash signal if this is set, so we can
  instead let gdb handle it.
	* glom/application.[h|cc]: Added set_stop_auto_server_shutdown() which calls
  it.
	* glom/main.cc: Add a --stop-auto-server-shutdown command line option that
  calls that.

2010-09-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc-desktop>

	Renamed Dialog_GroupBy_SecondaryFields to Dialog_FieldsList.

	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_groupby_second
	aryfields.[h|cc]: Rename to dialog_fieldslist.[h|cc]:
  * glom/glom_developer.glade: Renamed the ID too.
  adapted.
  * Makefile_glom.am:
  * glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_group_by.h:
  * tests/test_glade_derived_instantiation.cc:
  Adapted.
  This lets me use it for other things too.

2010-09-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build for the latest goocanvasmm and gtkmm API.

	* glom/mode_design/relationships_overview/canvas_group_dbtable.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/relationships_overview/dialog_relationships_over
	view.cc:
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.[h|cc]:
	* glom/utility_widgets/canvas/canvas_text_movable.[h|cc]:
  Use Goocanvas::AnchorType instead of (removed) Gtk::AnchorType.

2010-09-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build with latest gtkmm.

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.[h|cc]: on_expose_event(): Use
  Cairo for drawing instead of Gdk::GC, which no longer exists.

2010-09-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Avoid use of deprecated cairomm API.

	* configure.ac: Also check for CAIROMM deprecations.
	* glom/import_csv/dialog_import_csv.cc: Fix a bad git merge.

2010-08-19  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	Include the correct config.h

	* glom/application.cc:
	* glom/bakery/app_withdoc.cc:
	* glom/bakery/app_withdoc_gtk.cc:
	* glom/bakery/app_withdoc_gtk.h:
	* glom/bakery/dialog_offersave.cc:
	* glom/bakery/dialog_offersave.h:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.cc:
	* glom/libglom/document/bakery/document.cc:
	* glom/libglom/gst-package.c:
	* glom/main.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/translation/window_translations.cc:
	* glom/python_embed/glom_python.cc:
	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc:
	* glom/utils_ui.cc: Be sure to include the local config.h.

2010-08-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	SpinButtons: Don't have 0 to 0 ranges with only 0 increments possible.

	* glom/import_csv/dialog_import_csv.cc: (Import dialog)
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/box_formatting.cc:
  (Multiline text field height)
	* glom/utility_widgets/dialog_flowtable.cc: (number of columns in a group):
  Constructors: Set the range and increment manually, because Glade defaults
  to useless 0 values for these.
  This problem was introduced when we remove the extra adjustment objects
  from the .glade files, so we could simplify our use of Glade.
  It is a side-effect of GtkBuilder bug
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=575714
  This partially fixes bug #625693 (.cvs file import not working).

2010-08-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Catch exceptions from std::locale::global().

	* glom/main.cc: Put a try/catch around the call to std::locale::global(),
  because it is throwing on at least one system under apparently normal
  circumstances.
  This should fix bug #619445 (teidooricaerak) or at least give us another clue.

2010-08-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	test_document_autosave: Change the temp filename to avoid a clash.

	* tests/test_document_autosave.cc: Rename the file because we sometimes
  seem to clash with a directory of the same name.

2010-08-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Self-Hosting: Don't keep trying indefinitely when trying various ports.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres_self.cc: connect():
  Fix a logic error introcuced when removing the no-exceptions ifdefs.
  Now it only retries when a particular type of error happens, and otherwise
  fails.

2010-08-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the tests.

	* tests/test_selfhosting_new_empty.cc:
	* tests/test_selfhosting_new_from_example.cc: Adapt to the recent
  change return type of ConnectionPool::startup().

2010-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	FieldFormatting: Default to show-all for related choices.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/fieldformatting.cc:

2010-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	Formatting: Add get_choices_related() overload to reduce copy/pasted code.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/fieldformatting.[h|cc]:
  Added a get_choices_related() overload that returns the LayoutItem_Fields
  instead of just the field names. This reduces the copy/pasted code in the
  callers, and makes it easier to support related fields in future.
	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoices.[h|cc]:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: Adapted and made necessary
  const corrections.

2010-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Choices: Fix !show-all lists.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoices.[h|cc]:
  refresh_data_from_database_with_foreign_key(): Add a document parameter,
  used to update the cached choices information if necessary.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc: set_field_value(): Adapted.

2010-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Document loading: Show an error dialog even for unexpected errors.

	* glom/application.cc: on_document_load(): Don't just fail silently when
  there is an unexpected error, for instance if the postgres data directory
  is missing.

2010-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Utils::get_choice_values(): Reduce copy/pasted code.

	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]: build_sql_select_with_key(): Add a sort_clause
  parameter.
  get_choice_values(field): Rename this to get_choice_values_all() and change
  the implementation to just call the other get_choice_values(). Add
  a Document* parameter so we can do that.
  get_choice_values(document, field, ...): Sort the list by the first field.
  This should probably be an option in the developer-mode UI.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.h:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoices.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.h:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc:
  get_choice_values(): Adapt to the change, by adding a Document* parameter.
	* glom/base_db.cc: Adapt.

2010-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	DbAddDel: Avoid some copy/pasting of code to append items to choices cells.

	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: Added set_cell_choices(),
  using it in refresh_cell_choices_data_from_database_with_foreign_key() and
  construct_specified_columns_cellrenderer().

2010-08-06  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	Minor build system cleanup

	* configure.ac: Drop unnecessary AC_DISABLE_STATIC. Use AS_IF rather
	than shell if...fi. Add a TODO.
	* Makefile.am:
	* Makefile_tests.am: Take advantage of dependencies to reduce
	duplication of linker flags.

2010-08-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	List: Choices with !show_all: Update the list when the from_field changes.

	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]: Added a get_choice_values() overload that
	takes the foreign_key.
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]: Added get_choice_index()
	to get the affected choice lists when a field value changes.
	Added refresh_cell_choices_data_from_database_with_foreign_key() to update
	these lists.
	set_value(): Use these methods to update choice lists when appropriate,
	as already happens in the Details view.

2010-08-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	List view: When a value is edited, update other instances of the same field.

	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.[h|cc]:
	get_data_model_column_index(): Add a including_specified_field_layout bool
	parameter, used in a new set_value() method overload that has a
	set_specified_field_layout bool parameter.
	user_changed(): Call set_value() to show the new value in any other
	instances of the same field.
	The details view already does this.

2010-08-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	Simplified some code.

	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.[h|cc]: set_value(), set_other_value():
  Avoid copy/pasting of the code.

2010-08-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Choices with !show_all: Update the list when the from_field changes.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/fieldformatting.[h|cc]: Renamed
	set/get_choices() to set/get_choices_related().
	* glom/libglom/utils.cc:
	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/box_formatting.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: Adapted.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoices.[h|cc]: Remove the non-default
	constructor that took a second field.
	Move set_choices_with_second() to private.
	Add set_choices_related() and matching member variables.
	Add refresh_data_from_database_with_foreign_key(), like the one in
	Box_Data_RelatedRecords, which gets the related values and calls
	set_choices_with_second().
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo_as_radio_buttons.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/comboentry.[h|cc]: Adapt to the changed
	ComboChoices base API.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/datawidget.cc:
	create_combo_widget_for_field(): Do not take the second field as a parameter,
	because that is now specified later.
	Constructor: Simplify the code now that ComboChoices does more of the work.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc: set_field_value(),
	set_other_field_value(): Call refresh_data_from_database_with_foreign_key() on
	the choice widgets as they already does on the portals, to refresh the list of
	possible values.

2010-08-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	FlowTableWithFields: Added get_choices_widgets(from_field).

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/datawidget.cc: Constructor: Only fill the
	choices list at this point if show_all is set.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.[h|cc]: Addef get_choices_widgets(),
	like the existing get_portals() methods.

2010-08-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Field Formatting: Related Choices: Add a Show All checkbox.

	* glom/glom_developer.glade:
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/fieldformatting.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/box_formatting.[h|cc]:
	Add a Show All checkbox to the Related Choices section, so the developer
	may choose to restrict the choices depending on the relationship. The default
	(the previous behaviour) is to show all records from the related table.
	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc: save_before_layout_item_formatting(),
	save_after_layout_item_formatting(): Store the new bool in the document.
	* glom/libglom/utils.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/datawidget.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: Adapt the code to build, though
	the behaviour has not changed yet.

2010-07-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the tests build after the merge.

	* tests/test_selfhosting_new_empty.cc: Fix the use of Utils::.

2010-07-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the tests build after the merge.

	* tests/test_selfhosting_new_empty.cc: Fix the use of Utils::.

2010-07-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Rename libglom-1.14 to libglom-1.16 (parallel-installable)

	* configure.ac: Change the GLOM_ABI_VERSION number.
	* Makefile.am:
	* Makefile_libglom.am:
	* docs/pyglom_reference/Makefile.am:
	* docs/pyglom_reference/index.rst.in:
	* glom/libglom/init.h:
	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc:
	* tests/test_load_python_library.cc:
	* win32/build-installer:
	* win32/glom.iss.in: Change mentions of 1.14 to 1.16.

2010-07-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Adapt to recent gtkmm-3.0 API changes.

	* glom/bakery/app_withdoc_gtk.cc: Remove use of Gtk::RecentManager::set_limit().
	* glom/dialog_existing_or_new.[h|cc]:
	* glom/frame_glom.[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_data/notebook_data..[h|cc]:
	* glom/mode_design/report_layout/dialog_layout_report.[h|cc]:
	* glom/notebook_glom.[h|cc]: Replace use of GtkNotebookPage with Gtk::Widget*
	in switch_page signal handlers.

1.14.5:

2010-07-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Allow unique fields with same name in multiple tables.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.cc:
	change_column(): Prefix the table name to the constraint name when
	setting/removing the unique-key constraint, as libgda (or PostgreSQL)
	seems to do when creating a field. This prevents a clash when two tables
	have the same field name, and both should be unique.
	This is nasty code anyway that I would rather have in libgda.
	This fixes bug #625192 (fmyhr).

2010-07-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Added --restore command-line option.

	* glom/application.[h|cc]: Added init() with a bool restore option,
  calling do_backup_restore() if appropriate.
	* glom/main.cc: Added a --restore command and pass the bool result to
  Application::init().

  This allows the user to restore from a backup without first loading an
  existing file, though this is so far only possible via the terminal.

2010-07-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Added Developer/Restore Backup menu item.

	* glom/application.[h.cc]: Added a Developer/Restore Backup menu item,
  which lets the user choose a .tar.gz, untars it in /tmp/ and opens it.

	* tests/test_selfhosting_new_empty.cc:
	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]: Move delete_directory() to Utils.
  Added get_directory_child_with_suffix(), used to find the .glom file inside
  an untarred directory.

2010-07-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Saving from a backup: Now works.

	* glom/application.[h|cc]: on_document_load(): Simplify the code to
  create from a backup, modifying the from-example code to handle it too,
  calling a new recreate_database_from_backup() method.
  That now creates the database and then adds the groups before trying
  to restore from the backup file.
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/backend.h: convert_backup():
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.[h|cc]: convert_backup():
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/sqlite.[h|cc]: convert_backup():
  Add a database_name_parameter. This now expects the database to exist
  already, though it should be empty. It should also already have the
  expected groups.
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool.[h|cc]: convert_backup(): Supply the
  database name. Also update the meta data so we know about the new tables.

2010-07-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Small Business example: Add table privileges.

	* examples/example_smallbusiness.glom: Give some privileges to the
    accounts and personnel groups and resave-as-an-example. These were
    probably lost some time.

2010-07-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	Saving as example: Fix this.

	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc: set_modified(): Actually use
    m_allow_auto_save so we don't just save every time, overwriting
    previous saves. For instance, the examples were saved with is_example=false
    after the document was changed back.

2010-07-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	Saving from examples: Set the table privileges mentioned in the document.

	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]: Added set_table_privileges_groups_from_document().
	* glom/application.cc: recreate_database_from_example(): call it.

2010-07-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Saving from examples: Create the groups mentioned in the document.

	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]: Added add_groups_from_document().
	* glom/application.cc: recreate_database_from_example(): call it.

2010-07-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>>

	Fixed warnings with latest gtkmm-2.24

	* glom/mode_data/notebook_data.cc:
	* glom/mode_find/notebook_find.cc: Use Gtk::Notebook::append_page()
    instead of Gtk::Notebook::pages().push_back().

2010-07-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fixed warnings, even with the latest gtkmm-2.24.

	Many files: Try to include box.h or dialog.h before other treemodel.h.
    Sometimes just add a gtkmm.h to simplify things. This will not be necessary
    with gtkmm-3.0 (in glom's master branch).

2010-07-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc-desktop>

	PostgresQL backups: Suggest a dated name.

	* glom/application.cc: on_menu_developer_export_backup(): Suggest
    a directory name based on the current name and the date/time.
    Also use the directory name for the .glom filename, as we usually would do,
    instead of calling it just backup.glom.

2010-07-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	PostgreSQL backups: Archive the directory in a .tar.gz..

	* configure.ac: Check for the tar and gzip executables.
	* glom/application.cc: on_menu_developer_export_backup(): Use tar
    via the command line, to put it all in a .tar.gz, so it is self-contained.

2010-07-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	PostgreSQL backups: Use .pgpass.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres_self.[h|cc]:
    Move create_text_file() from PostgresSelf to Postgres and add an
    only_for_current_user bool parameter, so we can use it in a
    new save_password_to_pgpass() method.
    save_backup(), convert_backup(): Temporarily store the password in
    ~/.pgpass, so pg_dump and pg_restore actually work.

2010-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Show progress in the UI during backup saving and restoring.

	* glom/application.[h|cc]: on_document_load(),
    on_menu_developer_export_backup(): Show a pulsing progress dialog while
    waiting for backup exporting and restoring.
    on_menu_developer_export_backup(): Close the file chooser dialog as soon
    as we stop using it.

2010-07-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Improve backup saving and add backup restoring.

	* glom/libglom/document/document.[h|cc]: Added get/set_is_backup_file(),
	saved in the XML document..
  on_menu_developer_export_backup(): Mark the .glom file as a backup file.
	Rename recreate_database() to recreate_database_from_example().
	on_document_load(): Handle backup .glom files similarly to examples files,
	but using the backup file instead of example data.
	* glom/frame_glom.cc:
	* glom/libglom/connection_pool.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/backend.[h|cc]: startup(): Return a
	StartupErrors enum, to provide more clues, for instance to say that backup
	data was found.
	Add get/set_database_directory_uri(), replacing the one in sqlite.[h|cc] and
	replacing set_self_hosting_data_uri() in postgres_self.[hc|cc].
	save_backup(): Don't take a filepath - use get_database_directory_uri()
	instead.
	Added convert_backup() to restore from a backup.
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/sqlite.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.[h|cc]:
	get_path_to_postgres_executable(): Catch exceptions from Glib::build_filename().
	save_backup(): Use --format=c with pg_dump, because the default one can't be
	used with pg_restore.
	Implement convert_backup(), using pg_restore.
	Added get_self_hosting_config_path(), get_self_hosting_data_path() and
	get_self_hosting_backup_path() to avoid copy/pasting magic paths.
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres_self.[h|cc]:
	Adapted.
	* glom/application.[h|cc]:
	* tests/test_selfhosting_new_empty.cc: Adapted to check the enum result from
	startup().

2010-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Document: Avoid a crash when creating the parent directory.

	* glom/libglom/docment/bakery/document.cc: write_to_disk(): Check the
	result of Gio::File::get_parent() for null, because that happens if we
	provide a path instead of a URI.

2010-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Save as Example: Reset the old file URI and allow auto-saving again.

	* glom/application.cc: on_menu_file_save_as_example(): reset the old file
	URI and turn auto-saving back on again, because it makes no sense to leave
	the user editing an example document. This is really an export anyway.
	This allows the user to close the window again after saving as an example.

2010-07-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Add Save Backup menu item.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/backend.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/posgres.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/sqlite.[h|cc]: Added save_backup()
	virtual method, using pg_dump for PostgreSQL.
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool.[h|cc]: Add save_backup() here, calling the
	backend.
	* glom/application.cc: Add a Developer/Export Backup menu item, to use
	this feature. This also saves the .glom file.

2010-07-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Spawn functions: Catch some exceptions.

	* glom/libglom/spawn_with_feedback.cc():
	execute_command_line(), execute_command_line_and_wait(): Catch exceptions
	so that these functions don't throw, simplifying caller code. For instance,
	a command may be malformed and rejected by the shell.

2010-06-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/application.[h|cc]: Developer menu: Added an Export Backup menu item.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres_central.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres_self.[h|cc]: Moved
    m_host and m_port into the base class:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.[h|cc]:
    because they are used in both derived classes. Therefore remove port
    parameter from attempt_connect().
    Also move get_path_to_postgres_executable() and port_as_string() there
    so they can be used in the base class.

2010-06-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Improve stderr message.

	* glom/libglom/spawn_with_feedback.cc:
    execute_command_line_and_wait_until_second_command_returns_success():
    Correct the error message when a command (such as postgres) fails. As
    noticed in bug #617504.

2010-06-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Privs::get_database_users(): Check for an empty DataModel.

	* glom/libglom/privs.cc: Check that the user (listed in the group) could
	really be found.

2010-06-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use G_STRFUNC with std::cerr and std::cout.

	* *.h/cc: Replace hard-coded copy/pastes of method names with
	G_STRFUNC, with the help of regexxer.

2010-06-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Adapt use of Gda::ServerOperation.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/backend.cc: add_column(),
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/sqlite.cc:
	add_column_to_server_operation(): set_value_at() is now templated in libgdamm,
	so there is no need for the ugly (somebool ? "TRUE" : "FALSE") code.

2010-06-21  David King  <amigadave@amigadave.com>

	Explicitly link with libdl for Python module loading test

	* Makefile_tests.am: Do not rely on libdl being a dependency of a
	library in LIBGLOM_LIBS, by linking with it explicitly.

2010-06-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	libglom: ConnectionPool: Simplify code.

	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/backend.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres_central.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres_self.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/sqlite.[h|cc]: Remove the
	query_execute(), create_server_operation(), perform_server_operation(),
	begin_transaction(), commit_transaction() and rollback_transaction()
	convenience methods, which just hide the no-exceptions ifdefs.
	But gtkmm-3.0 does not support that anyway, so we don't need it.
	Just call the libgdamm methods directly.
	add_column(), drop_column(), change_columns(), connect():
	Remove the error output parameters which were there for the same reason.
	Now they just throw.
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool.[h|cc]: Adapted code, hopefully making it
	simpler.

2010-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use Gnome::Gda::SqlBuilder::Id

	* glom/base_db.cc:
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_relatedrecord.cc:
	* glom/libglom/utils.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/glom_db_treemodel.cc: Use the typedef
	instead of guint. It is very lengthy, but it is correct.

2010-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Remove the avahi-ui dependency because we don't use it any more.

	* configure.ac: Don't check for avahi-ui.
	* glom/application.cc: Don't include avahi-ui.h

	This is lucky, because avahi-ui still has no support for GTK+ 3.

2010-06-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use SqlBuilder::add_field_id() to avoid ambiguity.

	* glom/base_db.cc:
	* glom/base_db_table_data.cc:
	* glom/libglom/db_utils.cc:
	* glom/libglom/privs.cc:
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_record.cc:
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_relatedrecord.cc:
	* glom/libglom/utils.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_calendar_related.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_portal.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/dialog_database_preferences.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/fields/box_db_table_definition.cc:
	* glom/report_builder.cc: Replace use of add_id() with the new add_field_id(),
	which lets us specify the table too.

2010-06-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Adapt to latest libgdamm API.

	* glom/base_db.cc:
	* glom/libglom/db_utils.cc:
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_relatedrecord.cc:
	* glom/libglom/utils.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/glom_db_treemodel.cc:
	SqlBuilder::add_field_id() was renamed to add_field_value_id(), though I now
	notice that no value is involved when it is used for SELECT queries.

2010-06-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Remove unnecessary gtk C includes.

	* glom/application.cc:
	* glom/bakery/app_withdoc_gtk.cc:
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/print_layout.cc:
	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc:
	* glom/libglom/gst-package.c:
	* glom/mode_design/comboentry_currency.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/fields/combo_fieldtype.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/combobox_fields.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/combobox_relationship.cc:

	* glom/utility_widgets/combo_textglade.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/cellrenderer_buttonimage.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/cellrenderer_buttonimage.h:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/cellrenderer_buttontext.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/cellrenderer_buttontext.h:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/layouttoolbar.cc:
	* glom/xsl_utils.cc: Remove now-unnecessary gtk+/gtk* includes,
	replacing some with use of C++ API. These caused warnings due to GSEAL.

2010-06-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Depend on avahi-ui-3.0 instead of avahi-ui, though it does not officially exist.

	* configure.ac: avahi-ui links to gtk-2.0, so depending on avahi-ui-3.0 is
	better even if it currently only exists via my patch (emailed to d-d-l and
	Lennart because I can't login to avahi.org's trac).

2010-06-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Configure: Remove checks for libegg dependencies, because we don't use it.

	* configure.ac: We don't build libegg code here any more.

2010-06-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Port to gtkmm-3.0

	* configure.ac: Use gtkmm-3.0 instead of gtkmm-2.4
	* glom/mode_design/print_layouts/window_print_layout_edit.cc:
	Use get_related_action() instead of get_action().
	* glom/utility_widgets/cellrendererlist/cellrendererlist.[h|cc]:
	Simplify the use of the editing_started signal now that the inheritance is
	fixed in gtkmm-3.0.
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: Use get_first_cell() instead of
	get_first_cell_renderer().
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/glom_db_treemodel.[h|cc]: iter_is_valid():
	This is no longer virtual, and no longer exists in the base class, so don't
	call the base class implementation.

This is the master branch, for glom 2.0, using gtkmm-3.0.
See also the glom-1-16 branch, which uses gtkmm-2.4.

1.15.1:

2010-05-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/libglom/utils.cc: build_sql_select_with_where_clause(): Fix a crash.

2010-05-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	libglom: Utils: Avoid SQL strings for extra_join for doubly-related records.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/foundset.[h|cc]: Remove the extra_group_by
	member variable.
	* glom/base_db.cc: set_found_set_where_clause_for_portal(): Do not create
	the SQL GROUP BY string here.
	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]: build_sql_select_with_where_clause(): Remove
	the extra_group_by parameter, instead grouping by all fields if there is
	an extra_join_by, because there is a 1-to-1 correlation.
	Also take extra_join as a Relationship instead of a SQL JOIN string, and
	reuse the existing code to define a join from a relationship.
	* glom/frame_glom.cc:
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/foundset.cc:
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/foundset.h:
	* glom/libglom/utils.cc:
	* glom/libglom/utils.h:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_calendar_related.cc:
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_print_layout.cc:
	* glom/report_builder.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/glom_db_treemodel.cc: Adapt.

2010-05-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Document: get_field_used_in_relationship_to_one(): const correction.

	* glom/libglom/document/document.[h|cc]:
	get_field_used_in_relationship_to_one(): Make the relationship parameter
	const and adapt other code.

2010-05-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	libglom: build_sql_select_add_fields_to_get(): Define joins here.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/usesrelationship.[h|cc]:
	Remove add_sql_join_alias_definition(), moving its code into
	Utils::build_sql_select_add_fields_to_get() because that was the only code
	that called it.
	get/set_relationship(), get/set_related_relationship(): const corrections.
	* several files: Adapt to const corrections.

2010-05-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	UsesRelationship: Correct use of SqlBuilder for related relationships.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/usesrelationship.cc:
	add_sql_join_alias_definition(): Correct the join definition for
	related relationships.

2010-05-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	UsesRelationship: Use SqlBuilder::select_add_target() with the join.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/usesrelationship.cc:
    add_sql_join_alias_definition(): Use select_add_target() instead of
    add_id() with the join's first target, to avoid the warning about an
    unknown ID, though we now get a warning about unimplmented code in libgda,
    which I emailed the gnome-db mailing list about.

2010-05-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Really replace the last non-users string-based SQL query.

	* glom/libglom/db_utils.cc:
    get_database_preferences(): Add a missing call to select_add_target().
    insert_example_data(): Use SqlBuilder.

2010-05-14  Daniel Borgmann  <danielb@openismus.com>

	Fix position of "Records / Found" labels.

	* glom/glom.glade: Make sure "Records: X Found: X" appears in the right
	order.

2010-05-14  Daniel Borgmann  <danielb@openismus.com>

	Fix a crash when using find mode.

	* glom/application.cc: Don't access m_action_mode_data.
	* glom/application.h: Remove m_action_mode_data.

2010-05-12  Daniel Borgmann  <danielb@openismus.com>

	Don't allow deleting placeholder rows.

	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: Don't allow deleting a
	placeholder row (which leads to broken behaviour).

2010-05-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Correct use of SQL functions with SqlBuilder.

	* glom/base_db.cc: count_rows_returned_by(): Use SqlBuilder::add_field_id()
    so the function is really used. And add a target alias. This now works.
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_relatedrecord.cc: generic_aggregate()
	* glom/libglom/utils.cc: build_sql_select_add_fields_to_get():
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/glom_db_treemodel.cc: get_record_counts():
    Use add_field_id() when adding a function to SqlBuilder, so it is
    really used.

2010-05-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	More use of SqlBuilder. Almost finished.

	* glom/base_db.cc:
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/usesrelationship.[h|cc]:
    Change get_sql_join_alias_definition() to get_sql_join_alias_definition().
	* glom/libglom/db_utils.[h|cc]: query_execute_select(): Add an optional
    use_cursor bool to use the non-random database access.
	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]: Change build_sql_select_fields_to_get() to
    build_sql_select_add_fields_to_get().
    build_sql_select_with_where_clause(): Use SqlBuilder.
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/glom_db_treemodel.cc:
    refresh_from_database(): Use DbUtils::query_execute_select(), to simplify
    the code. This is possible now that the function is not in BaseDB.

2010-05-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	DbUtils: Catch SqlError exception.

	* glom/libglom/db_utils.cc: query_execute_select(), query_execute_select():
	Catch SqlError too, as this seems to be thrown too.

2010-05-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	DbUtils::query_execute(): Remove params parameter.

	* glom/libglom/db_utils.[h|cc]: query_execute(): Remove the unused params
	parameter.

2010-05-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use SqlBuilder in all possible remaining places.

	* glom/libglom/db_utils.[h|cc]: Renamed query_execute(string) to
	query_execute_string() so we catch uses of it that could use SqlBuilder.

	* glom/base_db.cc: Replaced some INSERT and DELETE string sql queries
	with SqlBuilder.
	* glom/base_db_table_data.cc:
	* glom/libglom/db_utils.cc:
	* glom/libglom/db_utils.h:

2010-05-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Remove redundant BaseDb::query_execute*() methods.

	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]: Removed query_execute_select() and query_execute().
	The same methods in DbUtils replace them.
	* glom/libglom/db_utils.[h|cc]: Removed the query_execute_select(string) override.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_calendar_related.cc:
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_details.cc:

	* glom/report_builder.cc:
	* glom/base_db_table_data.cc:
	* glom/frame_glom.cc:
	* glom/libglom/db_utils.cc: Adapted.

2010-05-11  Daniel Borgmann  <danielb@openismus.com>

	Don't add a new row when cancelling a placeholder edit.

	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: Don't add a new row
	if the edited row was a placeholder and no text was entered.

2010-05-10  Daniel Elstner  <danielk@openismus.com>

	Move list of libglom sources to separate file

	* glom/libglom/filelist.am: New Automake include file, defining the
	lists of source and header files for building libglom.
	* Makefile_libglom.am: Include glom/libglom/filelist.am for the lists
	of header and source files, instead of listing them directly.
	* docs/libglom_reference/Makefile.am: Include the list of libglom
	source files from glom/libglom/filelist.am.
	(doc_input): Instead of naming a directory for Doxygen to search,
	explicitly define the Doxygen input to the list of all public libglom
	header files.

2010-05-10  Daniel Elstner  <danielk@openismus.com>

	Update Doxygen configuration for libglom reference

	* docs/libglom_reference/Doxyfile.in: Correct strip prefixes and
	include paths.  Do include the mm-common stylesheet and reference
	the external tag files.  Also clean some cruft.

2010-05-10  Daniel Elstner  <danielk@openismus.com>

	Honor --disable-documentation configure option

	* Makefile.am (gnome_doc_subdirs): Rename from $(doc_subdirs).
	(doc_subdirs): Conditionally define to the subdirectories of the
	reference documentation, depending on whether ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION
	is true.
	(SUBDIRS): Expand $(doc_subdirs) and $(gnome_doc_subdirs).

2010-05-10  Daniel Borgmann  <danielb@openismus.com>

	Make Find mode a toggle and move it to the Edit menu.

	* glom/application.cc: Move Find menu item, remove Mode menu.
	* glom/frame_glom.cc/h: Replace on_menu_Mode_Find()/Data() with
	on_menu_Mode_Toggle().

2010-05-06  Daniel Borgmann  <danielb@openismus.com>

	Save extras alignment improvements.

	* glom/utility_widgets/filechooserdialog_saveextras.cc: Adjust
	alignments and hide extra label if empty (thus not taking up space).

2010-05-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Use Gnome::Gda::SqlExpr for where clauses.

	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]: Added build_simple_where_expression()
    and build_combined_where_expression() to make it easier to work with
    Gnome::Gda::SqlExpr.
    build_sql_select_with_key(): Return a SqlExpr instead of a string.
	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]:
	* glom/base_db_table_data.cc:
	* glom/frame_glom.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/foundset.[h|cc]:

	* glom/report_builder.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/glom_db_treemodel.cc:
    Adapt, using SqlExpr instead of a string for where clauses.

2010-05-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Utils::get_choice_values(): Complete the use of SqlBuilder.

	* glom/libglom/utils.cc: get_choice_values(): Use the new return value from
    Builder::select_add_field() for the ORDER BY, so we specify the field table
    too.

2010-05-03  Daniel Borgmann  <danielb@openismus.com>

	Set default icon instead of individual window icons.

	* glom/application.cc: Set default window icon.

	* glom/dialog_existing_or_new.cc:
	* glom/filechooser_export.cc:
	* glom/frame_glom.cc:
	* glom/glade_utils.h:
	* glom/mode_design/script_library/dialog_script_library.cc:

	* glom/utility_widgets/filechooserdialog_saveextras.cc:
	* glom/utils_ui.cc:
	* glom/window_boxholder.cc:

	Don't call set_icon_name() on individual windows.

1.14.2:

2010-05-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Python calculations: Really convert to expected types.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/glomconversions.cc:
	get_double_for_gda_value_numeric(): Handle all numeric GTypes - not just
	G_TYPE_INT..
	convert_value(): Remove the special case for G_TYPE_INT (now handled in
	get_double_for_gda_value_numeric instead). Make sure that all numeric GTypes
	are converted to GDA_TYPE_NUMERIC, making it easier for callers to check.

2010-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Add test of type conversion after python calculations.

	* Makefile_tests.am:
	* tests/test_python_execute_func_change_result_type.cc: Add a test that
	calls a python function that returns a number, for a text field, to
	check that the conversion is done.

2010-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Python scripts and calculations: Test buttons now show python errors.

	* glom/python_embed/glom_python.[h|cc]:
	glom_execute_python_function_implementation(),
	glom_evaluate_python_function_implementation(): Add an error_message output
	parameter, to report syntax errors, for instance.
	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fieldcalculation.cc:
  * glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_buttonscript.cc:
  Show the python error, if any, when pressing the Test button.
  * Other files: Adapt, ignoring the error message for now.
  * Makefile_tests.am:
	* tests/test_python_execute_func_bad_syntax.cc: Added a test of the new
	error_message parameter.

2010-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix a possible crash when showing choices.

	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combo.cc: set_text(): Don't show a warning if
	"" is not found because it's OK to use that to clear the combo.
	* glom/mode_data/datawidget/combochoiceswithtreemodel.cc:
	set_choices_with_second(): Don't dereference a null smartpointer, avoiding
	a crash with one .glom file that I tried.

2010-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Python Glom API documentation improvement.

	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc: Turn off auto-writing
	of the Python signatures in the docstrings, because that is a) crappy and
	b) confuses the sphinx autodoc module, which adds an invisible ..function
	reStrucuredText line.
	Add :param:, :type, and :returns: lines with the necessary indenting and
	empty lines needed by that invisible ..function line.

2010-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Move some more methods from Base_DB.

	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]: Move show_warning_no_records_found() to utils_ui.[h|cc].
	get_find_where_clause_quick(): Move to utils.[h|cc].
	* glom/frame_glom.cc: Adapted.
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/box_formatting.h:
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_buttonscript.[h|cc]:
		* glom/mode_data/datawidget/dialog_choose_id.[h|cc]: Don't derive from Base_DB
	because that is no longer necessary after adapting.

2010-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/libglom/db_utils.cc: create_database(): Actually use the progress slot.

2010-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Move some Base_DB methods to DbUtils and test database recreation.

	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]: Move many db-related methods to
	glom/libglom/db_utils.[h|cpp], taking a Document* paramater where necessary.
	This makes Base_DB slightly less of a mess, makes it clearer when we are
	doing Database IO, and makes it possible to do more testing of non-UI code.
	* Makefile_tests.am:
	* tests/test_selfhost_new_from_example.cc: Use DbUtils to recreate the
	database structure and data from the example file.
	* Many files: Adapted.

This is the master branch. See also the glom-1-14 branch.

2010-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix document saving (recently broken by me) and add a test for it.

	* glom/libglom/document/bakery/document.cc: write_to_disk():
	Do not fail if the parent directory already exists.
	* Makefile_tests.am:
	* tests/test_document_autosave.cc: Added a test of document saving and
	autosaving.

2010-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Move tests out of sub-directories, simplifying the build file.

	* tests/Makefile_test.am:
	* tests/test_document_load.cc:
	* tests/test_selfhosting_new_empty.cc: Move out of the sub-directories,
	because they do not need extra files.

2010-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	PyGlom: Don't use deprecated boost::python::args.

	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc: Use boost::python::arg()
	instead of boost::python::args(), because I noticed that args is deprecated.

2010-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    More use of SqlBuilder.

	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]: Move sqlbuilder_get_full_query() to Utils so that
    other code can use it.
	* glom/libglom/utils.[h|cc]: get_choice_values(): Use SqlBuilder.

2010-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    More use of SqlBuilder.

	* glom/report_builder.cc: report_build_groupby(): Use the new
    SqlBuilder::select_group_by() method to replace another SQL string.

1.14.1:

2010-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Make sure all glade-instantiated windows have the Glom icon.

	* glom/glade_utils.h: helper_get_glade_widget_derived_with_warning():
    Call set_icon_name() on windows, fixing my regression.

2010-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc-desktop>

    Documentation: Added libglom main page. Installed _sources for pyglom.

	* docs/pyglom_reference/Makefile.am: Also install html/_sources, used by search.
	* glom/libglom/init.h: Add a doxygen main page.

2010-04-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build.

	* Makefile_tests.am: test_selfhosting_new_empty: Link to the Glom sources
	to fix the unresolved link to Glom::Priv's method. We will use more from
	the rest of Glom here too.

2010-04-26  Daniel Elstner  <danielk@openismus.com>

	Use installed mm-common instead of copying it

	* autogen.sh: Run mm-common-prepare to pull in the mm-common include
	files for Automake.
	* docs/libglom_reference/Makefile.am: Set up configuration variables
	and include doc-reference.am instead of copy'n'pasting its content.
	* docs/libglom-reference/doxygen_to_devhelp.xsl: Delete file.  It is
	shipped with mm-common and also part of the glibmm installation.

2010-04-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Reenable test_load_document.

	* Makefile_tests.am: Reenable test_load_document.cc
	* tests/test_load_document/test_load_document.cc: Restore (rewrite) this
	missing file.

2010-04-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac: Remove the dist-bzip2 option that was added by mistake.

2010-04-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Self-Hosting test: Check that cleanup works.

	* Makefile_tests.am:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/backend.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool_backends/postgres_self.[h|cc]:
	* tests/test_selfhosting_new_empty/test_selfhosting_new_empty.cc:
	Make cleanup() return a bool, so we can check it, because this fails sometimes.
	Use the standard username and password.

2010-04-26  Daniel Elstner  <danielk@openismus.com>

	Heavily cut the pyglom_reference build magic

	* docs/pyglom_reference/Makefile.am: Drop the custom installation
	rules and use the GNU make $(wildcard) function for both distribution
	and installation of the generated documentation files.  Since the
	files do not undergo translation at install time, it is not necessary
	to integrate the custom installation tool from mm-common.  Pull in a
	missing GNU make function definition for computing the list of files.

2010-04-26  Daniel Elstner  <danielk@openismus.com>

	Temporarily disable test_document_load

	* Makefile_tests.am (check_PROGRAMS), (TESTS): Temporarily remove
	test_document_load, because the corresponding source file is currently
	missing from the repository.

2010-04-26  Daniel Elstner  <danielk@openismus.com>

	Enable maintainer-mode build in autogen.sh

	* autogen.sh: Run configure with --enable-maintainer-mode since the
	AM_MAINTAINER_MODE macro is now used in configure.ac.

2010-04-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Python Glom module: Improved the docstrings, using reStructuredText

	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc: Use more
    reStructureText (or as much as sphinx allows us to use in a docstring).
    It's looking quite good.

2010-04-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Simplify test_selfhosting_new_empty.

	* glom/frame_glom.cc: Move setup_connection_pool_from_document() to:
	* glom/libglom/connectionpool.[h|cc]: Added setup_from_document().
	* tests/test_selfhosting_new_empty/test_selfhosting_new_empty.cc: Use the
	new function here, removing code to explicitly set the backend.

2010-04-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Add a document-loading test and self-hosting test

	* glom/Makefile_tests.am: Added the tests.
	* glom/libglom/test_document.cc: Renamed to example_document_load.cc.
	* tests/test_document_load/test_document_load.cc: Added this new test to
	load a document, checking some known parts of its structure.

	* glom/libglom/document/bakery/document.cc: write_to_disk(): Create the
 	parent directory if necessary, instead of failing with a Gio exception.
 	* test/test_selfhosting_newempty/test_selfhosting_newempty.cc: Saves a new
 	file from an example, starts self-hosting of it, and stops self-hosting.
 	This needs work and expansion.

2010-04-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Python Glom module: Improve sphinx-generated documentation.

	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc: Added class docstring
	documentation, based on
	http://library.gnome.org/users/glom/unstable/sec-calculated-fields.html
	Use reStructuredText format as expected by sphinx and as apparently now
	use by Python for docstring text.

2010-04-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Fix the python Glom module name.

	* configure.ac: Fix a recent typo to again use the correct underlined
    name for the Python Glom module. This was fatal, in tests too.

2010-04-20  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	Relax the autoconf requirement

	* configure.ac: Relax the autoconf requirement to 2.63, as 2.65 is not
	required. Something older than 2.63 may even be acceptable, but I do
	not have an older version to test.

2010-04-20  David King  <davidk@openismus.com>

	Fix the sphinx-build configure check

	* configure.ac: Abort configure with an error if sphinx-build could
	not be found and --enable-documentation was passed to configure.

2010-04-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Glom Python API reference: Failed attempt to dist the html files.

	* docs/pyglom_reference/Makefile.am: Copied some stuff from the mm-common
    files, but it doesn't work yet.

2010-04-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Glom Python API reference: Install the html generated by sphinx.

	* docs/pyglom_reference/Makefile.am: Add install rules based on awful hacked
    copies of the mm-common stuff. I believe this could be far simpler.

2010-04-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Solve the long-paths problem with the doxygen-generated html files.

	* configure.ac: Change the AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE() call to be like gtkmm,
	allowing the tarball to contain long paths - needed for the libglom html
	documentation.

2010-04-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	More improved use of sphinx.

	* docs/pyglom_reference/conf.py.in: Do not generate the module index page
	because we have only one module.
	* docs/pyglom_reference/index.rst.in: Add back the link to the general index,
	which seems to actually be generated.

2010-04-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac: Ran autoupdate to remove use of deprecated macros.

2010-04-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Avoid the requirement for sphinx-build if documentation is disabled.

	* configure.ac: Use AC_PATH_PROG() instead of AC_CHECK_PROG() so we get the
    path to use. Only check if --enable-documentation was used.
	* docs/pyglom_reference/Makefile.am: Only build the html if
    --enable-documentation was used (not yet built by default anyway).

2010-04-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Improved use of sphinx.

	* configure.ac: AC_SUBST() GLOM_ABI_VERSION_UNDERLINED so we can use it
    in docs/pyglom_reference/Makefile.am. Mention these files that will be
    genereated form .in files with the ABI and version numbers substituted.
    Check for sphinx-build, though this should only matter when building docs.
	* docs/pyglom_reference/conf.py.in:
	* docs/pyglom_reference/index.rst.in: Use ABI and version variables instead
    of hard-coding. Add short introductory text with links.

2010-04-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Try to use sphinx for pyglom API documentation.

    * docs/pyglom_reference/Makefile.an:
	* docs/pyglom_reference/sphinx_sources/:
    An attempt to use sphinx instead of pydoc. sphinx is used by Python itself.
    I need to change my Python setup (not have Python in jhbuild) to test
    this properly, because I can't easily build pydoctor in my separate prefix.

2010-04-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Python: Really show warnings when modules can't be imported.

	* glom/python_embed/glom_python.cc: Add and use import_module() to make sure
	that we catch exceptions from boost::python::import(), so show the intended
	warnings instead of just crashing with an uncaught exception.
	Also correct the checks for empty/none boost::python::objects for imported
	modules. A simple ! is not what it seems.

2010-04-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Use mm-common for optional compiler warnings and to build libglom docs.

    * configure.ac: Use mm-common, removing macros/dk-warn.m4.
	* docs/libglom_reference/Doxyfile.in:
	* docs/libglom_reference/doxygen_to_devhelp.xsl:
	* docs/libglom_reference/Makefile.am: Generate libglom documentation
    properly usign build stuff copied from gtkmm.
	* docs/pyglom_reference/Makefile.am: A silly little initial attempt to
    have generated html for the glom python module, using pydoc.

2010-04-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Python field calculation: Fix a crash.

	* glom/libglom/python_embed/pygdavalue_conversions.cc:
	glom_pygda_value_as_boost_pyobject(): Add a PyDateTimeAPI call, as already
	done in glom_pygda_value_from_pyobject(), to prevent a crash (and valgrind
	warning about 0 dereference) when using this (silly, wrong) field calculation,
	though I can't reproduce it in a unit test:
	import datetime
  return (datetime.date.today() - record["date_of_birth"]).days / 365

2010-04-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Python module: Improve API documentation.

    GLOM_PKGDATADIR.

	* glom/glade_utils.h:  helper_get_glade_widget_derived_with_warning():
    Catch the other 2 exception types that we now know that
    Gtk::Builder::create*() can throw.
	* glom/frame_glom.cc: create_database(): Use get_glade_widget_with_warning()
    to simplify the code. Our utility functions are now used everywhere.

2010-04-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Remove useless translatable strings.

	* glom/glom_developer.glade: Remove placeholder text from labels that will

	Bug #615656 (Gianluca Ferri)

2010-04-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Python calculations and scripts: Fix regression in use of date and time fields.

	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_record.[h|cc]:
	Change PyGlomRecord_SetFields() to a member set_fields() method, and making
	more of the class private, finishing our conversion to boost::python.
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_related.[h|cc]:
	Change PyGlomRelated_SetRelationships() to a set_relationships methods.
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_relatedrecord.[h|cc]:
	Changed PyGlomRelatedRecord_SetRelationship() to a set_relationship() method.

	* glom/python_embed/glom_python.cc: glom_pygda_value_from_pyobject():
  Handle date, time, timestamp, geometric point values, whose code had been
  commented out since the port to boost::python.
	This fixes the test added in the previous commit, so glom calculations and
	scripts can again (it broke in unstable Glom 1.13) use date and time field
	values from the record.

2010-04-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Added test showing problem with date fields in python calculations.

	* tests/test_python_execute_func_date.cc: Added a test of dates as input
	values for record fields. This currently fails with this error from python,
	so I need to fix it in Glom:
	AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'year'

2010-04-12  Daniel Elstner  <danielk@openismus.com>

	Further clean up AX_BOOST_PYTHON_MURRAYC

2010-04-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Slight AX_BOOST_PYTHON_MURRAYC() cleanup.

	* macros/ax_boost_python_murrayc.m4: Add necessary quotes, avoid ==,
    and use AC_LANG_PUSH/AC_LANG_POP instead of deprecated
    AC_LANG_SAVE/AC_LANG_CPLUSPLUS/AC_LANG_RESTORE. Noticed by Daniel Elstner,
    though we don't know if this solves any known problems yet.

2010-04-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Provide context for translations.

	* glom/application.cc:
	* glom/frame_glom.cc:

    C_() macro to provide context for bare uses of "User" and "Developer",
    providing some explanation and allowing translators to use translate them
    differently, as may be required by some languages.

	dialog_run_with_help().

2010-04-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Glade instantiation: Simplify, make more robust, and test.

  * glom/glade_utils.h: get_glade_widget_derived_with_warning(),
  get_glade_developer_widget_derived_with_warning(): Add method overloads that
  don't take an ID. These require the class to have a static glade_id member.
  This associates the IDs with the class, instead of being in other files,
  to avoid duplication and to avoid using the wrong ones.
  * Many files: Use these new methods, to avoid mentioning glade IDs.
  * tests/test_glade_derived_instantiation.cc: Try to instantiate all the known
  derived glade dialogs.

    Glade files: Remove adjustment objects, simplifying window instantiation.

	* glom/glom_developer.glade: Remove useless (default, empty) adjustment
    objects, so we can load the windows with GtkBuilder without specifying
    them. Recent versions of Glade no longer seem to create these when they
    would just have default values.
	* glom/base_db.cc:
	* glom/frame_glom.cc:
	* glom/glom.glade:
	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fielddefinition.cc:

1.13.9:

2010-03-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Refactored combo classes.

	* glom/utility_widgets/comboglomchoicesbase.[h|cc]:
    Split into combochoices.[h|cc] and combochoiceswithtreemodel.[h|cc] so
    that combo_as_radio_buttons.[h|cc] doesn't need to have an unused treemodel.

2010-03-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Formatting: Choices: Add a Display as radio buttons option.

	* glom/glom_developer.glade: formatting: choices: Add a Show As Radio

    load and save the new formatting detail.
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/box_formatting.[h|cc]:
    Handle the new checkbox and make sure that it is only sensitive when
    the choices are restricted, because radio buttons provide no way to enter
    freeform data.
	* glom/utility_widgets/comboglomchoicesbase.h: Make set_choices() and
    set_choices_with_second() virtual.
    * glom/utility_widgets/combo_as_radio_buttons.[h|cc]: A new widget that is

    Fix the distcheck. Don't use deprecated gtkmm API.

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable_dnd.cc:
	* glom/utility_widgets/placeholder-glom.cc: Adapt to deprecated gtkmm API.
    Use get_has_window() and set_has_window() instead of get_flags(),

2010-03-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Small fixes to glade file.

	* glom/glom_developer.glade: Add some still-missing vbox orientation=vertical

  Tests: Check that the .glade files are valid XML.

  * Makefile_tests.am:
	* tests/test_glade_file_validation.sh: Add this text that the .glade files
	are basically valid XML. It would be nice to have a Glade DTD to validate
	them against too.
	We should also check that each top-level widget can be instantiated by
	GtkBuilder.

2010-03-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  * glom/mode_data/box_data.cc: execute_button_script(): Use the new callbacks
  class instead of using member methods here.
  * glom/application.cc: on_document_load(): Run the startup script, if any,
  after loading the document, using the new derived callbacks class.

  * Makefile_glom.am, Makefile_libglom.am: Mention the new files.

2010-03-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Initial Dialog: Do not crash sometimes if cancelling the file chooser.

	* glom/application.cc: offer_new_or_existing(): Show the dialog again if
    we get a 0 response, because we cannot (yet) prevent the dialog from
    doing this when the child file chooser dialog is cancelled. Fixes a crash
    if pressing the Select button instead of double-clicking on an item.
    Bug #612303 (David King)

1.13.8:

2010-03-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Slight update of Small Business example.

	* examples/example_smallbusiness.glom: Resave, with a new record with

2010-03-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Python button scripts: Rename print() to print_layout() and add start_new_record().

	* glom/frame_glom.[h|cc]
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_ui.[h|cc]
	* glom/mode_data/box_data.[h|cc]

	* glom/mode_data/notebook_data.[h|cc]
	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc:
	* tests/test_python_execute_script.cc:
    Add a ui.start_new_record() python method, and rename ui.print() to
    ui.print_layout() because print seems to be a python keyword that can't
    be used as a method name, seen when trying to use it in the unit test.

2010-03-08  Peter Penz  <ppenz@openismus.com>

	Fix the build with exceptions disabled.

	* glom/libglom/document/bakery/document_xml.cc:
	* glom/mode_design/iso_codes.cc: The exception handling is enabled by the
    define LIBXMLPP_EXCEPTIONS_ENABLED. But this is a typo, as libxml++ defines
    LIBXMLCPP_EXCEPTIONS_ENABLED.

2010-03-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Python button scripts: Add ui.print() and ui.print_reports(report_name).

	* glom/application.[h|cc]: Add print() and print_report(), calling
    methods in the frame widget.
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_ui.[h|cc]: Add new print() and
    print_report() methods, adding callback slots for use by Glom.
	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc: Register the new
    Python methods.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data.[h|cc]: execute_button_script(): Handle the

	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.[h|cc]: apply_size_group_to_label():
	Change this to apply_size_groups_to_label().
	align_child_group_labels(): Create a size group for each possible column,
	and call apply_size_groups_to_label() with them.

2010-03-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Align widgets in the first columns of neighbouring layout groups.

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.[h|cc]: Added get_column_for_first_widget(),
	to discover what column a widget is in, and whether it has even been assigned
	to a column yet (if the size has been allocated already.)
	FlowTableItem: Remember whether the item has a column number and what it is.
	on_size_allocate(): Remember the column numbers of items for later retrieval.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.[h|cc]: Info, add_field_at_position():
	Store the pointer to eventbox too, so we can later discover its column from
	the base FlowTable.
	Add align_child_group_labels(), to make all first-level labels in child
	flowtables share a single Gtk::SizeGroup, making them align.
	Add apply_size_group_to_labels() to actually add the labels to the size group.
	add_layout_group_at_position(): Call align_child_group_labels() on new
	sub-flowtables.
	on_size_allocate(): After the base class has allocated the spaces for the
	child widgets, after it therefore knows the column positions for the widgets,
	call apply_size_group_to_labels() to make them align.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_details.cc: create_layout(): Call
	align_child_group_labels() to align items in top-level groups.

2010-03-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Details: Do not make field widgets too wide, so this fits on a laptop screen.

	* glom/utils_ui.cc: get_suitable_field_width_for_widget(): Do not add 150
	to all calculated widths. I don't know why this code ever did that.

1.13.7:

2010-02-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

    Python button scripts: Avoid a crash with buttons in lists.

	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list.[h|cc]: on_adddel_script_button_clicked():
	Run the script in the (existing) on_script_button_idle() idle handler because
	the script can cause the cell (that is emitting the signal) to be destroyed,
	by navigating to a different table. This fixes that crash.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list_related.cc: Do the same here.
	* glom/mode_data/notebook_data.cc: on_list_user_requested_details(): Use
	the same idle handler trick here, just in case.

2010-02-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	an exception in the tests.

2010-02-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Many files: Rename App_Glom to Application (in namespace Glom).

2010-02-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Python button scripts: Add show_table_details() and show_table_list().

	* Makefile_libglom.am:
	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.cc:
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_ui.[h|cc]: Added a PyGlomUI object
	that can be passed to python functions in addition to the record object,
	with methods to navigate in the UI. So far there is just
	show_table_details() and show_table_list().
	* glom/glom_developer.glade: Script editor window: Mention the extra ui
	parameter.
	* glom/python_embed/glom_python.[h|cc]: Add a callback object parameter so
	scripts can tell the caller to change things in the UI.

	call it.
	* glom/application.[h|cc]: Add show_table_details() and add_show_list()
	methods for the callbacks to call.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data.[h|cc]: Handle the callback signals, to actually do
	the navigation when a python script requests it.
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_buttonscript.cc: Adapted.

2010-02-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Python: Prevent field calculations from changing the data in other fields.

	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_record.[h|cc]: Added set_read_only().
	* glom/python_embed/glom_python.[h|cc]:
	glom_evaluate_python_function_implementation(): Add a bool read_only
	parameter that defaults to true.
	glom_execute_python_function_implementation(): Pass read_only=false so
	scripts can write data to the database via the record object.

2010-02-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Increase required version of libgdamm.

	* configure.ac: Increase libgdamm dependency to the last one that doesn't
	need libgda 4.1/4.2. We actually need some API that was not in the older one.

2010-02-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Revert use of SqlBuilder because it requires libgda 4.1,
  which will not be packaged by the upcoming Ubuntu Lucid, which is an

	* glom/libglom/document/bakery/document.cc: get_name():
	Use Gio::FileInfo::get_display_name() instead of
	Glib::filename_display_basename() or Glib::filename_display_name(), to avoid
	showing %20 in the window title bar when there are spaces in the file name.
	Noticed by Daniel Borgmann.

1.13.5:

	Disable broken import tests.

	* Makefile_tests.am: Comment out the use of the import tests during
	make check. They hang most of the time, which is just stopping distcheck
	from working. We need to fix these (and or the importing itself).
	Then we can reenable them.

2010-02-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	libglom/python_embed/: get_item(): Pass object by const reference.

	Change this to a .cc file, using C++, using boost::python.

2010-02-08  Peter Penz <ppenz@openismus.com>

	libglom: Fix build issue for Maemo.

2010-02-03  Michael Hasselmann  <michaelh@openismus.com>

	Fixed a crash that got uncovered by the previous commit

	* glom/libglom/utils.cc (build_sql_select_fields_to_get): Warn about layout
	items that are null and skip them.

2010-02-03  Michael Hasselmann  <michaelh@openismus.com>

	Added a guard clause when adding relationships from fields

	* glom/libglom/utils.cc (add_to_relationships_list): If an invalid layout item
	is passed then its relationship cannot be queried. Libglom users can also force
	layout item fields that are null into this function, hence an additional guard
	clause was added.

2010-02-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Do not include pygtk.h

	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_record.h:
	* glom/libglom/python_embed/py_glom_relatedrecord.h:
	* glom/python_embed/glom_python.cc: Include pygobject.h instead of
	pygtk/pygtk.h, because we do not use anything from pygtk, or link to it.

2010-01-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Command-line parsing: Added some checks.

	* glom/main.cc: Test the command-line argument filepath for existence and
	check that it's not a directory, so it fails before even showing UI.

2010-01-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Relationships Overview: Avoid GTK+ warnings.

	* glom/mode_design/relationships_overview/dialog_relationships_overview.cc:
	Constructor: Call add_accel_group(), which fixes the warnings during
	destruction mentioned in bug #607938.

2010-01-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Relationships Overview: Maybe fix a hang/crash.

	* glom/mode_design/relationships_overview/dialog_relationships_overview.[h|cc]:
	Signal handlers: Take sigc::bind() RefPtr parameters by value instead of by
	const &, to avoid having to use sigc::ref() or worry if it works.
	Save sigc::connections in a list so we can disconnect signal handlers when
	deleting items bound with sigc::bind(). Do this in the destructor too, which
	seems to fix the valgrind errors in bug #594737, though not the
	instance of invalid non-instantiatable type" warning.

2010-01-27  Michael Hasselmann  <michaelh@openismus.com>

	Fixed the parser to perform stateless async file operations

	* glom/import_csv/csv_parser.[h|cc]: The parser relied on a member variable for
	its async giomm operations, which was able to cause interleaving state
	changes to it, corrupting the object in the worst case. This commit uses the
	source object as a slot parameter to avoid this state problem (working around
	BGO bug #608269).

	* tests/import/utils.[h|cc]: During import tests, break mainloop on file
	read errors (e.g., no file at all).

2010-01-27  Michael Hasselmann  <michaelh@openismus.com>

	Added a test for BGO bug #607938

	* tests/import/data/albums.csv: Real-world example data used for the CSV
	import.

	* tests/import/utils.[h|cc]: Add the possibility to feed a filename into the
	ImportTest directly.

	* tests/import/test_parsing.cc: Test the CSV import of a whole file.

2010-01-27  Michael Hasselmann  <michaelh@openismus.com>

	Added a g_return_if_fail check for invalid URLs

	* glom/import_csv/csv_parser.cc: Do not start the async reading if the file
	object is invalid.

2010-01-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Use Gtk::ToolPalette from the latest gtkmm version, instead of
	EggToolPalette (C) from libegg.

2010-01-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	libglom: Correct includes.

	* glom/libglom/*.h: Use the full include libglom/ path for headers, to
	avoid confusion and make life easier for other users of libglom.

2010-01-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/numeric_format.h: Remove unnecessary
	include of privileges.h.

2010-01-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Allow new files to have quotes in their titles.

	* glom/frame_glom.cc:
	connection_request_password_and_choose_new_database_name():
	Remove quotes (and other unusual characters) from the generated
	database name, to avoid errors from the database backend.
	Bug #607957 (Michael Hasselmann)

2010-01-24  Michael Hasselmann  <michael@taschenorakel.de>

	Fixed out-ouf-bounds access during CSV imports

	* glom/import_csv/dialog_import_csv.cc (get_field_for_column): Added boundary
	check for direct field access. Fixes bug #607938.

2010-01-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* ldtp/central-info.xml.example: Added an example central-info.xml, as
	mentioned in the README.

1.13.2:

2010-01-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Buttons: Use horizontal aligment from formatting.

	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc: add_button_at_position():
	Use a Gtk::HBox with either pack_start() or pack_end(), putting it in the
	FlowTable with expand=true to have alignment in the button's space, if we
	don't want the FlowTable's default (left) alignment.

2010-01-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Static Text items: Use horizontal alignment from formatting.

	* glom/utility_widgets/labelglom.[h|cc]: Add a constructor that does not
	take alignment values, like the Gtk::Label base class, so we can easily
	use the default for vertical alignment.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc: add_textobject_at_position():
	Use expand=true when adding the widget to the FlowTable, so that labels can
	have the full space in which to actually have alignment.
	* glom/utility_widgets/layoutwidgetbase.cc: apply_formatting: Use appropriate
	multi-line justification for labels, as a user would expect when setting
	horizontal alignment.

2010-01-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Buttons: Use background color from formatting.

	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc: add_button_at_position(): Call
	apply_formatting on the button, not the label, so it has a chance to do the
	right thing on the right widget.

2010-01-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Static Text items: Use background color from formatting.

	* glom/utility_widgets/labelglom.cc: Do not call set_visible_window(false)
	because we really need a visible child X window to be able to change the
	background color.

2010-01-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Static Text items and Buttons: Use foreground color from formatting.

	* glom/utility_widgets/layoutwidgetbase.cc: apply_formatting(): Use the
	foreground color for labels (static text items and buttons).

2010-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Details: Static Text items: Use formatting.

	* glom/utility_widgets/labelglom.[h|cc]: Added get_label(), because this
	really has a label as a child.
	* glom/utility_widgets/layoutwidgetbase.cc: apply_formatting(): Use get_label()
	to make formatting work on static text items too.

2.13.1:

2010-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fixed compiler warnings.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/layoutitem_field.cc:
	get_formatting_used_horizontal_alignment():

	* glom/python_embed/python_module/py_glom_module.[h|cc]: Mention
	2.14 instead of 2.14.

	* glom/libglom/document/document.cc:
	get_latest_known_document_format_version(): Increment.

2010-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Really use formatting for multi-line fields.

	* glom/utility_widgets/textviewglom.[h|cc]: Added get_textview().
	* glom/utility_widgets/layoutwidgetbase.cc: apply_formatting():
	Get the appropriate child for buttons and textviews, making this work
	for textviews (multi line fields), but it still does not work for
	labels (static text items) and buttons.

2010-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Allow custom text formatting of Buttons as well as text items and fields.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/layoutitem_button.[h|cc]:
	Derive from LayoutItem_WithFormatting.

	formatting generic so we get it for free whenever a new class
	derives from LayoutItem_WithFormatting.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc:
	on_dnd_add_layout_item_button(): Try to apply the formatting to
	the button's label, though it doesn't seem to work.

2010-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Allow editing of formatting for static text items.

	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/dialog_formatting.[h|cc]:
	Added generic formatting (not choices, not default/custom) dialog
	for static text items and maybe others.
	* glom/mode_design/layout/layout_item_dialogs/box_formatting.[h|cc]:
	set_formatting(): Add optional bool paramters to hide numeric formatting
	and choices.
	* glom/base_db.[h|cc]: Added offer_item_formatting() to use this dialog.
	* glom/mode_design/layout/dialog_layout_details.cc(): Allow editing of
	the formatting for static text items instead of just fields.

	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc:
	construct_specified_columns_cellrenderer(): Apply the formatting to
	any LayoutItem_WithFormatting, not just fields.
	* glom/mode_data/flowtablewithfields.cc: add_textobject_at_position():
	Try to apply the formatting to the label, but it doesn't seem to work.

2010-01-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Add LayoutItem_WithFormatting as a Field/StaticText common base class.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/layoutitem_withformatting.[h|cc]:
	Added LayoutItem_WithFormatting.
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/layoutitem_text.[h|cc]:
	* glom/libglom/data_structure/layout/layoutitem_field.[h|cc]:
	Derive from Layout_WithFormatting, so we can use the base class
	polymorphically, making it easier to support formatting for static text
	items.
	* glom/utility_widgets/layoutwidgetbase.[h|cc]: apply_formatting(),
	* glom/print_layout/canvas_layout_item.[h|cc]: apply_formatting():

	Field Formatting: Negative values color: Make this just a bool check box.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/numeric_format.[h|cc]: Use just a bool
	to say if negative values should be shown in an alternative color.

	Fix a crash in previous commit.

	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: get_fixed_cell_height():
	Fixed a null-pointer crash when also checking LayoutItem_Text items,
	though the UI doesn't actually allow the font to be specified for them
	yet.

2010-01-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	List View: Don't chop off the bottom of text when using large fonts.

	* glom/utility_widgets/db_adddel/db_adddel.cc: get_fixed_cell_height():
	Use the font description from the FieldFormatting, to get a more
	suitable max height for all columns.
	remove_all_columns(): Set m_fixed_cell_height back to 0 so it

	Fixes bug #607023 (Michael Hasselmann)

2010-01-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	libglom: Some API documentation.

	Make the default precision used for stringstreams available for libglom users

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/glomconversions.[h|cc]
	(get_stringstream_precision_default): Wrap the constant used into a function
	and export it in the headers. Users of libglom need it to show the same

	Minor simplification.

	* glom/libglom/data_structure/glomconversions.cc:
