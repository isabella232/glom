"<literal>Relationships</literal>: Each table might be related to other "
"tables, via fields in both tables. For instance, a \"Customers\" table could "
"have a relationship to the \"Invoices\" table, so that people could see all "
"the invoices for that customer. Only developers need to understand this "
"concept. In other documents and applications, relationships are sometimes "
"called \"Joins\"."
